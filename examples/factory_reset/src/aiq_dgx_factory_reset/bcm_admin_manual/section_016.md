### **Monitoring: Job Monitoring**

**11.1** **Job Metrics Introduction**


Most HPC administrators set up device-centric monitoring to keep track of cluster node resource use.
This means that metrics are selected for devices, and the results can then be seen over a period of time.
The results can be viewed as a graph or data table, according to the viewing option chosen. This is
covered in Chapter 10.
The administrator can also select a job that is currently running, or that has recently run, and get
metrics for nodes, memory, CPU, storage, and other resource use for the job. This is known as _job_
_monitoring_, which is, as the term suggests, about job-centric rather than device-centric monitoring. Job
monitoring is covered in this chapter, and uses _job metrics_ .
For perspective, monitoring as discussed until now has been based on using devices or jobs as the
buckets for which resource use values are gathered. Administrators can also gather, for resources consumed by jobs, the resources used by users (or any other classifier entity) as the buckets for the values,
with the help of promQL-based queries. This is typically useful for watching over the resources used
by a user (or other classifier entity) when jobs are run on the cluster. User-centric monitoring—or more
generally, PromQL-based classifier-centric monitoring—for jobs is termed _job accounting_ and is covered
in Chapter 12.


**11.2** **Job Metrics With Cgroups**


Job metrics collection uses control groups ( cgroups ), (section 7.10). Each job is associated with a specific cgroup that is created in each of the three base cgroups that are associated with particular cgroup
controllers. The cgroup controllers are kernel components that allow metrics to be collected for processes. The PIDs of these processes are in the cgroups t asks file.
NVIDIA Base Command Manager 11 uses the following cgroup controllers:


 - blkio : provides block device metrics,


 - cpuacct : provides CPU usage metrics,


 - memory : provides memory usage metrics.


In NVIDIA Base Command Manager before version 9.1, each job had to be put by a workload manager into a unique cgroup. However, from NVIDIA Base Command Manager 9.1 onward, this no longer
necessary. By default, BCM still configures all supported workload managers to run jobs in cgroups, but
it is now CMDaemon that manages the cgroup life cycle. Thus, CMDaemon ensures that:


  - the necessary cgroups are created per job


  - ensures that the cgroups are removed after the job is finished


  - and that the last values of the metrics are collected.


**636** **Monitoring: Job Monitoring**


Even if the administrator completely disables cgroups management in the workload manager, CMDaemon can still create and remove the three cgroups associated with the job, with each of those cgroups
associated with one of the three previously-mentioned cgroup controllers.
If the workload manager creates some (or all three) cgroups for a job, then CMDaemon does not try
to recreate the cgroup, but does take charge of the removal of cgroups.
In NVIDIA Base Command Manager before version 9.1, cm-wlm-setup configured systemd to use a
joined cgroup with the following parameter settings:


**Example**


[root@node001 ~]# grep JoinControllers /etc/systemd/system.conf

JoinControllers=blkio,cpuacct,memory,freezer

[root@node001 ~]#


Currently this is not needed. However, if this setting remains, then CMDaemon can still collect job
metrics. In order to reset the cgroup layout to the default one, the administrator can run:


cm-wlm-setup --reset-cgroups


This command removes the JoinControllers parameter and regenerates initrd. A reboot of the
nodes is required after this.
When a job is started CMDaemon detects all the job processes. CMDaemon then ensures that the
required cgroups are created, and allocates the detected processes to those cgroups. CMDaemon does
not configure the cgroups in any way—this is the responsibility of the workload manager.
The tables in Appendix G.1.8 list the job metrics that BCM can monitor and visualize.
If job metrics are set up (section 11.4), then:


1. on virtual machines, block device metrics may be unavailable because of virtualization.


2. for now, the metrics are retrieved from cgroups created by the workload manager for each job.
When the job is finished the cgroup is removed from the filesystem along with all the collected
data. Retrieving the jobs metric data therefore means that CMDaemon must sample the cgroup
metrics before the job is finished. If CMDaemon is not running during a time period for any reason,
then the metrics for that time period cannot be collected, even if CMDaemon starts later.


3. block device metrics are collected for each block device by default. Thus, if there are _N_ block
devices, then there are _N_ collected block device metrics. The monitored block devices can be
excluded by configuration as indicated in section 11.4.


**11.3** **Job Information Retention**


Each job adds a set of metric values to the monitoring data. The longer a job runs, the more data is
added to the data. By default, old values are cleaned up from the database in order to limit its size. In
NVIDIA Base Command Manager 11 there are several advanced configuration directives to control the
job data retention, with names and default values as follows:


**Advanced Configuration Directive** **Default value** **Unit**


JobInformationDisabled 0


JobInformationKeepDuration 2419200 s


JobInformationKeepCount 8192


JobInformationMinimalJobDuration 0 s


JobInformationFlushInterval 600 s


These directives are described in detail in Appendix C, page 870.


**11.4 Job Metrics Sampling Configuration** **637**


**11.4** **Job Metrics Sampling Configuration**


Job metrics sampling can be configured to varying degrees. For clusters where hundreds of thousands
of jobs are run in a day it often makes little sense to monitor jobs, and it is often helpful to disable the
JobSampler and JobMetadataSampler data producers:


**Example**


[basecm11]% monitoring setup

[basecm11->monitoring->setup]% set jobsampler disabled yes

[basecm11->monitoring->setup]% set jobmetadatasampler disabled yes

[basecm11->monitoring->setup]% commit


An alternative is to use the equivalent CMDaemon directive JobInformationDisabled, as explained
on page 612.
If however CMDaemon is to keep the monitoring data, then the collection of job metrics is carried
out from the cgroups in which a job runs. The administrator can tune some low level metric collection
options for the JobSampler data producer in the jobmetricsettings submode:


**Example**


[basecm11]% monitoring setup

[basecm11->monitoring->setup]% use jobsampler

[basecm11->monitoring->setup[JobSampler]% jobmetricsettings

[basecm11->monitoring->setup[JobSampler]->jobmetricsettings]% show

Pickup priority Priority of the pickup interval change (default: 50)


The amount of monitoring data gathered can also be reduced by reducing the Maximal age and
Maximal samples for data producers (section 10.4.1) to smaller, but still non-zero values. A way to do
this is described in section 14.8.4.


**11.4.1** **The Job Metrics Collection Processing Mechanism**

**The** cm-cgroup-job-keepalive **Process**
From NVIDIA Base Command Manager 9.0 onward, when a WLM job starts, CMDaemon tracks the
moment it starts and finishes, and is able to collect metrics for it. As part of this enhanced jobs metrics
collection, a keepalive process, cm-cgroup-job-keepalive, is run for each job. Each keepalive process
is a temporary process, and is added by CMDaemon to the same cgroup that the original job was placed
in by the WLM.
The process cm-cgroup-job-keepalive itself does no work. It sleeps, and by existing it prevents its
cgroup being deleted.
After a job is finished, the workload manager would normally remove the related cgroup. However


**11.5 Job Monitoring In** cmsh **639**


the existence of the cm-cgroup-job-keepalive process prevents the deletion. This allows CMDaemon
to collect the very last metrics data for the job from the cgroup when the job finishes. The CMDaemon
then stops the cm-cgroup-job-keepalive process, and the cgroup is then removed because it is no
longer needed.
When CMDaemon starts the cm-cgroup-job-keepalive process for a job, it passes the appropriate job ID, and how long it can run, in its command line options. Those values are not used by the
cm-cgroup-job-keepalive process itself, but they are convenient for seeing what job the process is running for, and how long the job has run since it was started. For example, for a Slurm job with id 2 the
running cgroup keeper process could look like:


**Example**


[root@node001 ~]# ps auxf | tail -n 10 | cut -b18-45 --complement
root 1954 0 Sl 18:12 0:03 _ /cm/local/apps/cmd/sbin/cmd -s -n -P /var/run/cmd.pid
root 2632 0 Ss 18:15 0:00 _ /cm/local/apps/cmd/sbin/cm-cgroup-job-keepalive --job 2 8w
root 2241 0 S 18:13 0:00 /cm/shared/apps/slurm/18.08.4/sbin/slurmd
root 2627 0 Sl 18:15 0:00 slurmstepd: [2.batch]
cmsuppo+ 2631 0 S 18:15 0:00 _ /bin/bash /cm/local/apps/slurm/var/spool/job00002/slurm_script
cmsuppo+ 2642 0 S 18:15 0:00 _ /cm/shared/apps/stresscpu/current/stresscpu2
cmsuppo+ 2643 0 S 18:15 0:00 _ /cm/shared/apps/stresscpu/current/stresscpu2
cmsuppo+ 2644 98 R 18:15 4:46 _ /cm/shared/apps/stresscpu/current/stresscpu2

[root@node001 ~]#


(The cut command is just used in the example to cut out the middle bits of the output so that it fits
the page format well).


**The** Keep Alive Sleep **Time**
By default the cgroup keeper process stops after 8 weeks. This value should be increased if the jobs
that are expected to run will take longer than 8 weeks. The value can be set in the Keep Alive Sleep
parameter of the job metrics settings. If a job runs for longer than the value of Keep Alive Sleep,
then CMDaemon cannot collect the very last metrics (from around the time that the job has finished).
However all other metrics will be collected for the job as expected, even if the job running time exceeds
the Keep Alive Sleep time.


**The** OOB intervals **Parameter**

When metric collection for a new job has just started, CMDaemon samples more frequently than later
on. This more frequent sampling behaviour is defined by the parameter OOB intervals (out of band
sampling interval) in the data producer configuration. In the case of job metrics collection this more
frequent sampling behaviour is in JobSampler .
By default, the sampling interval retuns to the standard Interval value (with a default value of
120s), as defined in the data producer settings, after the value of Pickup times (with a default value of
12) has been exceeded.


The parameter Exclude Metrics can be used to exclude metrics that are currently enabled. For
example, if advanced metrics collection is enabled then Exclude Metrics allows either default or advanced metrics to be excluded by name.


**11.5** **Job Monitoring In** cmsh


The following commands are associated with monitoring job measurables within jobs submode ( cmsh

- wlm<[ _workload manager_ ]> - jobs, section 7.7):


**The** measurables **Command**

A list of job-associated measurables can be seen in the jobs submode ( cmsh > [< _workload manager_ ]> >
jobs ) using the measurables command with a job ID. For example (much output elided):


**640** **Monitoring: Job Monitoring**


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% measurables 26

blkio.io_service_bytes_total

...

memory.usage

[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]%


A list of node-associated measurables can also be seen if the -n option is used (much output elided):


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% measurables -n 26

...

gpu_power_usage:gpu0

...

memory.usage


**The** filter **Command**

The filter command uses options to provide filtered historic job-related information. It does not provide measurables data. The command and its options can be used to:


  - retrieve running, pending, failed or finished jobs information


  - select job data using regular expressions to filter by job ID


  - list jobs by user name, user group, or workload manager


Running filter without options simply lists an unfiltered list.
Filtering on a job name can be done with the -n|--name option, and the --limit option can be used
to limit the number of results displayed:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% filter -n mgbench --ended --limit 2

Job ID Job name User Queue Submit time Start time End time Nodes Exit code

------ -------- ----- ----- --------------- --------------- --------------- ------- --------
26 mgbench alice defq May 14 11:21:41 May 14 11:36:36 May 14 11:50:24 node001 0

[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]%


The data shown is retrieved from the running workload manager, as well as from the accounting file
or database maintained by the workload manager.
Further details on the options to filter can be seen by running help filter .


**The** info **Command**

A handy command to obtain job information is info, followed by the job number:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% info 25

**The** dumpmonitoringdata **Command**
The dumpmonitoringdata command displays data for measurables in the jobs submode ( cmsh >

[< _workload manager_ ]> > jobs ). It is a very similar to the dumpmonitoringdata command for measurables in device mode (section 10.6.4). The main difference in the behavior of dumpmonitoringdata for
these modes is that:


  - In the jobs submode it shows monitoring data over a period of time for a specified job ID


  - In device mode ( cmsh > device ) it shows monitoring data over a period of time for a specified
device.


A less obvious difference is that:


  - In the jobs submode the start and end time for the monitoring data for the job does not need to be
specified. By default the start and end time of the job is assumed.


  - In device mode the start and end time for the monitoring data for the device must be specified


The usage of the dumpmonitoringdata command for job measurables is:


dumpmonitoringdata [ _OPTIONS_ ] [< _start-time_  - < _end-time_ >] < _measurable_  - < _job ID_  

Options allow measurables to be retrieved and presented in various ways, including by maximum
value, raw or interpolated data, and human-friendly forms. The user can also specify custom periods
for the options.
For example, a historical job with job ID 4 that uses nodes node001 and node002 might display output
for the job-associated measurable memory.usage as follows:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% dumpmonitoringdata memory.usage 4

Start: Wed Feb 8 20:07:54 2023

End: Wed Feb 8 20:07:55 2023

The start and end times are optional, so specifying them is typically unnecessary. If they are not specified, then the data values that were found over the entire period of the job run are displayed.
That job with ID 26, for the example used in this section 11.5, happens to be mgbench, a GPU
benchmarking program that runs on nodes. So displaying output for the node-associated measurable,
gpu_power_usage, during the job run can also be useful:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% dumpmonitoringdata gpu_power_usage:gpu0 26

Start: Thu May 14 11:36:36 2020

End: Thu May 14 11:50:24 2020

2020/05/14 11:50:24 22.2241 W

[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]%


The data is shown per node if the job uses several nodes.
Further details of the options to dumpmonitoringdata for job metrics can be seen by running help
dumpmonitoringdata within jobs mode.


**The** statistics **Command**

The statistics command shows basic statistics for historical job information. It allows statistics to be
filtered per user or user group, and workload manager. The statistics can be grouped by hour, day, week
or a custom interval.


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% statistics

### **Monitoring: Job Accounting**

**12.1** **Introduction**


In addition to the concept of metrics for devices (Chapter 10), or the concept of metrics for jobs (Chapter 11), there is also the concept of metrics gathered for a classifier entity, for resources used during jobs.
This last one is typically metrics gathered per user, for resources used during jobs.
Classifier-based metrics gathering for jobs can use classification done with PromQL queries on labeled entities (sections 12.2- 12.8), or it can be done with CMDaemon database queries (section 12.9).
Classifier-based metrics gathering for jobs is more conveniently called _job accounting_, partly because
it ressembles the idea of an accountant watching over users to track their resource use while they carry
out their jobs.
The concept, implementation, analysis, and visualization of job accounting are described in this
Chapter.
For example, in BCM jobs resource usage can be presented per user. Thus, if there are jobs in a queue
that are being processed, then the jobs can be listed:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% list | head

Type Job ID User Queue Running time Status Nodes

------------ ------------ ------ ------- ------------ ---------- ------------------
Slurm 1325 tim defq 1m 2s COMPLETED node001..node003

Slurm 1326 tim defq 1m 1s COMPLETED node001..node003

Slurm 1327 tim defq 1m 2s COMPLETED node001..node003

Slurm 1328 tim defq 32s RUNNING node001..node003

Slurm 1329 tim defq 0s PENDING


The resource usage statistics gathered per user, for example for a user tim, can then be analyzed and
visualized using the job accounting interface of Base View (section 12.5).


**12.2** **Labeled Entities**


In job accounting, job metrics during a run are tagged with extra labels, such as the job ID, host name,
and the user running the job. The modified job metrics object that is tagged in this way then becomes a
job accounting-related object, called a labeled entity.
Administrators interested in using job accounting can simply skip ahead and start reading about the
Base View job accounting interface in 12.5, and just explore it directly. Those who would prefer some
background on how job accounting is integrated with BCM and PromQL, can continue reading this
section (12.2) and the next one ( 12.3).


**644** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


**12.2.1** **Dataproducers For Labeled Entities**
To view labeled entities in cmsh, the path to the labeledentity submode is:
cmsh  - monitoring  - labeledentity
The labeledentity submode allows job accounting-related objects, called labeled entities, to be
viewed. The labels are in the form < _key_ >="< _value_ >", for example: hostname="node001", or user="alice" .
The default, existing labeled entities are created from the built-in JobSampler and
JobMetadataSampler dataproducers when a job is run. Custom samplers, of type prometheus,
can be used to create further custom labeled entities. A custom sampler dataproducer, for example
customsamplerextras, can be created from the monitoring setup mode of cmsh as follows:


**Example**


[basecm11]% monitoring setup

[basecm11->monitoring->setup]% add prometheus customsamplerextras

[basecm11->monitoring->setup*[customsamplerextras*]]%


The customsamplerextras dataproducer can now have its properties configured and committed as
described in section 10.5.4.


**12.2.2** **PromQL And Labeled Entities**

Labeled entities can be used by administrators to help create and debug job-related queries in the
Prometheus query language, PromQL. PromQL is a part of the Prometheus monitoring and alerting
toolkit ( [https://prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io) ). Basic PromQL documentation is available at [https://prometheus.](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)
[io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) .


**12.2.3** **Job IDs And Labeled Entities**

Each job ID has a number of labeled entities associated with it. Since the number of labeled entities
scales with the number of nodes and jobs, the number of labeled entities can be very large. Therefore,
if examining these entities using the CMDaemon front ends such as cmsh or Base View, then filtering
or sorting the output is useful. For example, labeled entities associated with node001, and with the
JobSampler data producer, and with job 1329 from the preceding output, could be viewed by filtering
the full list of labeled entities as follows (output truncated and ellipsized):


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% list|head -2; list|grep 'job_id="1329"' |grep node001 |grep JobSampler
Index Name (key) ...

------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...

45446 hostname="node001",job="JobSampler",job_id="1329",wlm="slurm" ...

45447 device="vda",hostname="node001",job="JobSampler",job_id="1329",wlm="slurm" ...

45448 device="vda",hostname="node001",job="JobSampler",job_id="1329",mode="read",wlm="slurm"...

...


**12.2.4** **Measurables And Labeled Entities**

The measurables (metrics) for an entity can be listed with the measurables (or metrics ) command. For
a particular entity with a JobSampler property and index value of 45447, the command can be run as
follows:


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% measurables 45447

Type Name Parameter Class Producer

------- ---------------------------------- -------------- ----------- -------------
Metric job_blkio_sectors Prometheus JobSampler

Metric job_blkio_time_seconds Prometheus JobSampler

[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]%


**12.3 PromQL Queries** **645**


In the labeledentity mode of cmsh, the measurables listing command, which lists the measurables
for labeled entities, should not be confused with the measurable navigation command, which brings
the administrator to the measurable submode under the main monitoring mode.


**12.3** **PromQL Queries**


**12.3.1** **The Default PromQL Queries...**

By default there are several predefined PromQL queries already available. The queries can be listed
from the query submode:


**Example**

The queries can be conceptually divided into their classes, which at the time of writing (May 2023)
are: accounting, cluster, container, jobs, kubernetes, along with various drilldown levels which
classifies the queries according to various groups. The grouping for drilldown levels can be confusing,
and the drilldownoverview command (section 12.8.1) can be helfpul in clarifying the query intention
for these.

By default, queries of all classes are sampled over a period, except for the accounting and drilldown
metrics.

A metric in the accounting class query is evaluated (interpolated) from existing values. These existing values are raw samples gathered over the period, up to the time when the query is evaluated.

The listings give an idea of what the query does.

for each user.

The PromQL query code itself is typically a few lines long, and can also be viewed and modified

**12.3.4** **An Example PromQL Query, Properties, And Disassembly**
The users_job_cpu_usage query is a standard predefined query, and is used as an example here. The
query shows the CPU usage by a user around the time the sample was taken. It is sometimes called an
“instantaneous” value. However it is not that instantaneous, because its value is calculated by taking
samples of the CPU usage over the last 10 minutes of the job run rather than at the query time. The code
for the query can be viewed with:


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->query]% get users_job_cpu_usage promqlquery
sum by(user) (
irate(job_cpuacct_usage_seconds[10m])

  - on(wlm, job_id, hostname) group_right()
(job_metadata_is_running)

)


For those unfamiliar with PromQL, some disassembly of the users_job_cpu_usage query is helpful.
Terminology used by PromQL and BCM, for the pieces used to build the query, is listed in the following table:


**PromQL Terminology** **Example** **BCM Terminology**


Query users_job_cpu_usage PromQL query


Instant query job_cpuacct_usage_seconds Metric (from JobSampler dataproducer, belonging to the Prometheus
class)


Range vector job_cpuacct_usage_seconds[10m] Metric samples over a time span


As was mentioned before: job account metrics, unlike traditional metrics, are not directly associated
with the device-related objects. For such metrics, the monitoring data command dumpmonitoringdata
is therefore not accessed in cmsh from device mode or category mode.
Instead, the Prometheus metric job_cpuacct_usage_seconds, for example, is accessed via the
labeledentities mode.

The properties and interpolated values at a particular instant of time for the metric can be accessed
via an instantquery such as (some output excised for clarity):


**652** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% instantquery job_cpuacct_usage_seconds

Name hostname job job_id user wlm Timestamp Value

-------------------------- -------- ----------- ------- ----- ----- --------- ----
job_cpuacct_usage_seconds node001 JobSampler 623 tony slurm 15:52:15 129

job_cpuacct_usage_seconds node002 JobSampler 624 tony slurm 15:52:15 71

...


The properties and interpolated values of the metric over a range of time can be accessed via a
rangequery such as (some output excised for clarity):


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% rangequery --start now-2h --end now job_cpuacct_usage_seconds

Name hostname job job_id user wlm Timestamp Value

-------------------------- -------- ----------- ------- ----- ----- --------- ----
job_cpuacct_usage_seconds node001 JobSampler 623 tony slurm 13:52:15 82

job_cpuacct_usage_seconds node001 JobSampler 623 tony slurm 14:52:15 97

job_cpuacct_usage_seconds node001 JobSampler 623 tony slurm 15:52:15 129

job_cpuacct_usage_seconds node002 JobSampler 624 tony slurm 13:52:15 46

job_cpuacct_usage_seconds node002 JobSampler 624 tony slurm 14:52:15 23

...


The association of the instantquery and rangequery output with job accounts is because its dataproducer is JobSampler .
Further options for the instantquery and rangequery commands can be found in their help texts
within cmsh .


**12.3.5** **Aside: Getting Raw Values For A Prometheus Class Metric**
The PromQL language is aimed at providing an overall view of jobs and resource usage. The actual
individual raw values that Prometheus metrics are built on—the entries in the Time Series Database

(TSDB)—are not regarded as being important for the end user. The emphasis in PromQL is on seeing
the values as seen by statistical reworking.
This section, which is about the raw TSDB values, is thus provided as background information for
administrators who would anyway like to see what the raw values look like.
Raw values of the metric for a job ID can be accessed by using the index of the labeled identity that is
associated with that job ID. For example, job ID 624 can have its index found with some grepping (some
output elided or excised for clarity):


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% list|head -2; list|grep ' hostname='| grep 'job_id="624"'
Index Name (key) Introduction Last used

------ ----------------------------------------------------- ------------ --------
4060 hostname="node001",job="JobSampler",job_id="624", ... 13:30:03 16:00:03

[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]%


The index for the job ID 624 is 4060. The job ID can be used by the dumpmonitoringdata command
to show the series raw values along with their time stamps:


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% dumpmonitoringdata -24h now job_cpuacct_usage_seconds 4060

**12.3.6** **...An Example PromQL Query, Properties, And Disassembly (Continued)**
Getting back from the aside about raw values, and continuing on with the example PromQL query from
the start of this section (page 651), the query code for the query users_job_cpu_usage was:


sum by(user) (
irate(job_cpuacct_usage_seconds[10m])

  - on(wlm, job_id, hostname) group_right()
(job_metadata_is_running)

)


With the necessary background explanations having been carried out, the disassembly of this query
can now be done:

The core of the query is built around the job sampler metric job_cpuacct_usage_seconds .
The irate measurement in this case calculates the rate of change based on the last two most recent
values in the Prometheus range vector.
The Prometheus range vector is formed from the Prometheus instant query by using the square
brackets with a time value enclosed ( job_cpuacct_usage_seconds[10m] ). The Prometheus instant
query is, as the terminology table earlier pointed out, the Prometheus version of the job sampler metric.
Getting back to the range vector, a range vector in general is a series of values formed from the
corresponding Prometheus instant query. With the instant query being job_cpuacct_usage_seconds
here, the range vector is formed over a span of 10 minutes.
After the irate function has taken the average, the resultant is what in PromQL is called an instant vector value. This consists of data in the form {CPU seconds consumed during period, timestamp
associated with time period sample}. The instant vector value is then joined against each vector element of the pair job_id, hostname to generate the labeled identifier for the job running on the node. The
group_right of the result uses the wlm, job_id and hostname as the leading labels in the label identifiers.


**654** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


The job_metadata_is_running function means that values are generated only while job_metadata is
running. The sum by(user) function means that the metric is aggregated over all raw data and grouped
by user.
Visualisation based on the result is most easily carried out by plotting job CPU usage for each user
against time in the period specified, which can be done in a more user-friendly way with Base View.
The users_job_wall_clock_seconds query, is similar, and can be used to plot wall clock seconds
consumed by a user over the last period:


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->query]% get users_job_wall_clock_seconds promqlquery
sum by(user) (
max_over_time(job_metadata_running_seconds[$period])

  - on(wlm, job_id) group_right()
max_over_time(job_metadata_num_cpus[$period])

)

[basecm11->monitoring->query]%


Predefined queries can be executed in the labeledentity mode with the -q option:


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% instantquery -q users_job_wall_clock_seconds

# using default parameter: period=1w

Name user Timestamp Value Unit

----------------------------- -------- ------------------------- ------------------- -------
users_job_wall_clock_seconds alice Fri Feb 10 16:05:01 2023 17896.886001110077 s

users_job_wall_clock_seconds bob Fri Feb 10 16:05:01 2023 20670.46400117874 s

users_job_wall_clock_seconds charlie Fri Feb 10 16:05:01 2023 10947.136002540588 s


If no period is specified with the -p|--parameter option, then the default period is 1w as the output
indicates.

If Base View is used instead of cmsh, then Prometheus queries can be selected via the navigation
path:
_Menu bar_  - _Accounting and reporting icon_  - Monitoring  - PromQL Queries  - Show/Hide query selection


For example the users_job_wall_clock_seconds query can be selected, its query parameter can be
set to 1 week, the change saved, and the query run.


**12.4** **Parameterized PromQL Queries**


It is also possible to create parameterized queries using the < _key_ >="< _value_ >" labels in the labeled entities
mode.

This is handy for running the same query with different parameters or other drilldown options.
For example, an existing unparameterized query

users_job_wall_clock_seconds
can be used as a starting point:


[basecm11->monitoring->query]% get users_job_wall_clock_seconds promqlquery
sum by(user) (
max_over_time(job_metadata_running_seconds[$period])

  - on(wlm, job_id) group_right()
max_over_time(job_metadata_num_cpus[$period])

)


For convenience, the original query can be cloned over to a new, soon-to-be-parameterized, query
called

users_job_wall_clock_per_account_seconds
using


**12.4 Parameterized PromQL Queries** **655**


[basecm11->monitoring->query]% clone users_job_wall_clock_seconds users_job_wall_clock_per_account_seconds


The idea is that Slurm accounts become a parameter in the new query.
Parameter fields can now be added to the query. All fields in
users_job_wall_clock_per_account_seconds can be replaced verbatim. So any part of the query
can be made into a parameter.


[basecm11->monitoring->query]% get users_job_wall_clock_per_account_seconds promqlquery
sum by(user) (
max_over_time(job_metadata_running_seconds{account="${account}"}[$period])

  - on(wlm, job_id) group_right()
max_over_time(job_metadata_num_cpus{account="${account}"}[$period])

)


Some further adjustments are:


[basecm11->monitoring->query]% use users_job_wall_clock_per_account_seconds

[basecm11->monitoring->query[use users_job_wall_clock_per_account_seconds]% set class account/level/1

[basecm11->..._seconds*]% set description "Wall clock time used by users per account for the last period"

[basecm11->monitoring->query*[use users_job_wall_clock_per_account_seconds*]% commit


The new query can then be run by the administrator on demand.
The original query sums over all accounts:


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% instantquery -q users_job_wall_clock_seconds

user Timestamp Value

--------- ------------------------- ------------------
alice Mon Jun 24 10:25:20 2019 28.787

bob Mon Jun 24 10:25:20 2019 26.787

charline Mon Jun 24 10:25:20 2019 102.83

eve Mon Jun 24 10:25:20 2019 58.574

frank Mon Jun 24 10:25:20 2019 85.362


The parameterized query lets the administrator run the same query for specific accounts.
If Slurm accounts for physics phys and mathematics math have been created with


[root@basecm11 ~]# sacctmgr add account phys,math


then account=phys and account=math, are the < _key_ >="< _value_ >" format options. The query can then
be run with the -p|--parameter option as follows:


[basecm11->monitoring->labeledentity]% instantquery -q users_job_wall_clock_per_account_second _\_

s -p account=phys -p period=1w

**656** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


**12.4.1** **Two Job GPU Metrics Used In PromQL Queries**

There are two important job GPU metrics (section G.1.8) that are used in several PromQL queries. These

two are:


1. The job_gpu_utilization GPU metric:


This is based on the gpu_utilization metric collected on GPU nodes via the DCGM library. The
[values it takes are in the interval [0, 1]. In DCGM the name of the metric is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval) DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL,
and it represents the total GPU utilization.


The gpu_utilization metric values collected on the GPU are mapped to the job that uses the GPU
at the time of the collection.


job_gpu_utilization is a labeled entity, tagged with a label representing a job. This allows the
person carrying out PromQL queries to use such parameters as job id, job user, and so on. It
is assumed that one GPU is used only by processes of a single job, but there can be several GPUs,
each used by different jobs simultaneously. Each of the GPUs on the node has independent values
of job_gpu_utilization .


One example of a PromQL query that uses the job_gpu_utilization GPU metric is
job_names_usage_gpu, which has the query expansion:


sum by(job_name) (
sum_over_time(job_gpu_utilization[${period}])

)


2. The job_gpu_wasted GPU metric:


The job_gpu_wasted metric is a labeled entity (tagged metric) and is based on the
job_gpu_utilization metric. The job_gpu_wasted metric shows what fraction, out of 1, of the GPUs
on the node were unused by a job despite being allocated by the workload manager for that job. It
can take values in the interval [0, 1].


It is calculated as follows:


1 _−_ `[all]` [_] `[gp][us]` [_] `[utilization]`

~~`requested`~~ _ ~~`gpus`~~

where


   - all_gpus_utilization is the average utilization for all gpu_utilization metric values collected
in the interval [-1; +1] from the time of the metric calculation for all GPUs requested by the
job on the node


   - requested_gpus is the number of GPUs allocated for the job in the workload manager


For example:


If a job requests two GPUs on a node, and the job does not use any of those GPUs at all, then
job_gpu_wasted takes the value 1 .


If the same job uses half of the first GPU and does not use the second one, then the metric value is
calculated as:


1 _−_ [(] [0.5] [+] [0] [)] = 0.75

2


One example of a PromQL query that uses job_gpu_wasted is jobs_wasted_allocated_gpus, which
has the query expansion:


avg by(job_id) (
round(100 * avg_over_time(job_gpu_wasted[${period}]))

)

**12.5** **Job Accounting In Base View**


Job accounting in Base View is designed to present accounts of jobs without having to construct command lines with syntaxes that can be tricky to deal with. One useful output format is as basic Excelformat spreadsheets.
Job accounting can be viewed within Base View’s accounting mode by clicking on the calculator icon
( ) at the top right hand corner of the Base View standard display (figure 10.5).
By default, job accounting opens up with a dashboard report called K8S Container Metrics, which
provides some Kubernetes container metrics panels (figure 12.1).
If Kubernetes containers have been running jobs that have been sampled, then pre-selected containerrelated queries can be run from these panels, and the data samples can be displayed as tables or plots. If
Kubernetes containers have not been running jobs, then the pre-selected container-related queries have
no data samples to display (figure 12.1):


Figure 12.1: Job accounting: K8S container metrics panels


If the _⊕_ icon next to the K8S Container Metrics tab is clicked, then a new dashboard report can be
created. With the default options it displays a dashboard report with n accounting panel that has some
pre-selected queries related to user jobs over the last period (figure 12.2):

**12.5.1** **Management And Use Of The Accounting Panel**
The following description is illustrated by figure 12.2:
A Base View job accounting dashboard is made up of collections of Base View job accounting panels.


  - To add a new dashboard, the _⃝_ + button can be clicked in the dashboard menu bar. An existing
dashboard can be removed by clicking on the trash icon in the menu bar associated with that
existing dashboard.


  - To add a new panel, the _⃝_ + button can be clicked in the panel menu bar. An existing panel can be
removed by clicking on the trash icon in the menu bar associated with that existing panel.


Job accounting is intended to present accounts of jobs. So, when a new dashboard is created, a dialog
asks for inputs such as the time period over which the report is to be carried out, and the report name.
When the new dashboard is created, several predefined PromQL queries are selected by default.
These can be modified using selection checkboxes within the query list. The query list can be shown or
hidden by clicking on the Show/hide query list icon ( ).
By default, when the new dashboard is saved, the selected queries are run and a table can be seen of
the results.

How to run and view PromQL queries in the Base View accounting panel is described in this section
(12.5). The PromQL query specification itself in Base View is described in more detail in section 12.6.


**PromQL Queries Input In The Accounting Panel**
The PromQL queries (page 645) that are to be used can be managed in the query list associated with the
Show/hide query list icon ( ).
Checkboxes can be ticked to select multiple queries, as long as the query classes allow it. The class
restrictions are dynamically enforced by Base View by graying out the queries that cannot be checkboxed
as query checkboxes are ticked.
To tick a new class of query in the same panel, all the queries that do not match the new class must
first be unticked.


**12.5 Job Accounting In Base View** **659**


PromQL queries can by run in two modes: basic or advanced, by toggling the advanced icon ( ) of
figure 12.2. In basic mode, several instant queries can be run. In advanced mode, only one instant query
or a single range query can be run per panel.


**Display Of The Results Of PromQL Query Runs In The Accounting Panel: Rows, Pie Charts, And Plots**
The display of a run result can be managed by clicking on the Show/Hide table icon ( ), or clicking on
the Show/Hide chart icon. ( ).


  - The table option toggles the display of the result as rows of data per classifier (user) (figure 12.3):


Figure 12.3: Job accounting: PromQL query instant mode table display


The classifier can be a user, a cluster, an account, or any other key in the labeled entity.


  - The chart option toggle toggles the display of the result as a chart.


**–**
For a PromQL instant mode query, the chart can be a pie or doughnut chart (figure 12.4), or
an x-y plot if the x-axis values are time.


Figure 12.4: Job accounting: PromQL query instant mode pie chart display


The pie chart shows how much of the resource is used at that instant per user, per cluster, per
account, or per other classifier.

How much of the resource is used can be displayed upon the pie chart in figures, either as
the amount itself, or as a percentage of the total classifier amount.

The pie chart can display classifiers using a maximum of 10 slices, by default. If needed, the
right amount of the smallest extra slices are grouped together as one slice, others, so that the
maximum number is not exceeded


**660** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


**–**
For a PromQL range mode query, the chart is an x-y plot, with the x-axis being time (figure 12.5):


Figure 12.5: Job accounting: PromQL query instant mode x-y plot display


To have it display, the plot requires that


       - [the advanced mode (] ) be active


       - [the chart mode (] ) be active


       - [the range query mode (] ) be active


       - [the query state be saved (] ), and then run ( )


The plot shows resource use versus time. The plot can be per user, cluster, account, or other
classifier.

A particular user or other classifier can be highlighted on the plot by placing the mouse
pointer over the appropriate legend color icon.


How Base View is used to take PromQL query run inputs, and present PromQL query run results,
has been covered in this section without going into much detail on PromQL specification itself for the
run. PromQL specification is covered in more detail in the next section.


**12.6** **PromQL Query Modes And Specification In Base View**


The advanced mode of Base View’s PromQL query mode specification is essentially a superset of the
basic mode specification. The options that are described next for advanced mode therefore essentially
include descriptions for the options for basic mode.
Advanced mode has the following options:


  - the PromQL Query : Advanced mode allows the PromQL query itself to be edited in an editing box.


  - the Query Mode : This can be either Instant query mode ( ), which deals with instant query
types, or it can be Range query mode ( ), which deals with range query types. Only advanced
mode handles both query modes—basic mode only deals with instant query mode.


**12.6 PromQL Query Modes And Specification In Base View** **661**


**–** An Instant Query Type is executed at a particular instant. The instant at which it is executed
is now by default, but it can be set to a time earlier on. It outputs a single number for each
entity (for example, a user). The number for the entity is the interpolated data value for the
PromQL query at that time. The data values obtained by the PromQL query are typically a
list of the data values for each entity (for example, a list of memory consumed for each user)
over a preceding time period, where the preceding time period is defined in the PromQL

query.
The single number obtained by the query for each entity is typically used to summarize a
value at that instant for that entity.
An example of the Instant query type is users_job_waiting_seconds . This provides the
total waiting time, in seconds, for each user, for the jobs the users ran during the past period.
The past period is a time period, such as a week, defined for the query. Thus, the waiting
time is caculated at the instant of time ( Time ) specified for the query, over the past period.
If the Time parameter for the query is kept as the default value of now, then the query provides
the latest value for each user.

If the Time parameter is set to a time earlier on, then the query picks up the value at that
earlier time in the past, or provides an interpolated value at that earlier time, for each user,
and bases the calculation on a past period going further back from that earlier time.
The display can be presented in rows of {user, value} pairs using the Show/Hide table icon
( ). The display can also be presented as a pie chart using the Show/Hide chart option ( ).
In the chart each slice is proportional to the value for the particular user, compared with the
total value for all the users. Instead of a pie chart, the visualization can instead be a ring (or
doughnut) chart, which is really just a pie chart with a hole in the centre.
Basic mode does have an advantage over advanced mode in that it allows multiple instant
queries to be run in an account pannel. Correspondingly, multiple results are displayed in
the form of multiple sets of table entries and multiple pie charts. An advanced mode instant
query run, in contrast, only allows one instant query to be run, with a corresponding result
of one set of table entries, and one pie chart.
PromQL allows a variety of time specifications. The interface validates whatever the interface
user types in, and there is a calendar widget that allows an absolute time to be specified. Some
useful time specifications are:


**Example**


**Time specification** **What time is meant**

now at the time it is run


now-30m 30 minutes ago


now-1h one hour ago


now-1h/h an hour ago, starting at the start of that hour


now-2d 48 hours ago


now-0d/d today’s midnight (the most recently-passed midnight) _[∗]_


now-1d/d yesterday’s midnight _[∗∗]_


now-2d/d day before yesterday’s midnight


Thursday, July 11, 2019 17:00:00 an absolute time (as set by the calendar widget)
~~_∗_~~ The meaning can be understood by looking at how /d operates. It rounds off the day by truncation,
which in the case of now-0d/d means the midnight prior to now.
_∗∗_ Similarly, yesterday’s midnight is the midnight immediately prior to 24 hours ago.


The time units for PromQL are ( [https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#range-vector-selectors)
[basics/#range-vector-selectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#range-vector-selectors) ):


**662** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


        - [s] [ - seconds]


        - [m] [ - minutes]


        - [h] [ - hour]


        - [d] [ - day]


        - [w] [ - week]


        - [M] [ - month (31 days).] [ M] [ is not a PromQL unit, so it cannot be used inside a query. But it is]
a handy alias in BCM for an invariant time of 31 days.


        - [y] [ - year]


The     - operator in Prometheus is an offset operator, used only after now in the time specification field. The /< _time unit_      - syntax implies a start at that unit of time.

Thus if, for example, now-1d/d is set as the end time, then when the query runs, it picks up
the values at “yesterday’s midnight.” For each user, the value is the number of seconds the
job of the user was in a wait state for the week prior to yesterday’s midnight. It rounds off
the day by truncation, which in the case of now-1d/d means the midnight prior to 24 hours
ago. Varying the user means that the number of seconds varies accordingly.


The results of a run can be


       - [displayed in rows as values in Base View itself (figure 12.3)]


       - [downloaded as a CSV file]


       - [downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet.]


The last two options are convenient for plotting graphs that are more sophisticated than what
Base View offers.


**–** A Range Query Type

The Range query mode can only be accessed from advanced mode, and allows the range
query type to be executed.

This range query type is executed over a time period. It fetches a value for each interval
within that time range, and then plots these values.

An example of the Range query type is users_job_memory_usage_bytes . This fetches the total memory usage for jobs over intervals, grouped per user during that interval (figure 12.6).
The query submitter can set Start time and End time parameters. However, very long
ranges can be computationally expensive.


**12.7 Access Control For Workload Accounting And Reporting** **663**


Figure 12.6: Job Accounting: User Values Over A Range


  - the Interval : The interval is the plot interval along the time axis. When editing a range query
type, the interval for a range query run is set when the Save button is clicked. Lower numbers
lead to smaller intervals, hence higher resolution and higher query execution times. A value of
0 means that a reasonable default interval is attempted. Choosing an interval that is less than
the sampling time of the metric is a bit pointless, and tends to lead to data values that display
non-smooth behaviour.


**12.7** **Access Control For Workload Accounting And Reporting**


The ability to view jobs is controlled by four tokens defined in a user’s profile:


1. GET_JOB_TOKEN : Allows all running jobs to be seen.


2. GET_OWN_JOB_TOKEN : Allows owned running jobs to be seen.


3. GET_JOBINFO_TOKEN : Allows all cached historic and running jobs to be seen.


4. GET_OWN_JOBINFO_TOKEN : Allows owned cached historic and running jobs to be seen.


To retrieve monitoring data for the job, the token PLOT_TOKEN must also be defined for the profile.
A job is always owned by the user that runs it. Ownership of a job can also be shared with other
users by defining _project managers_ . This establishes a 2-level hierarchy, with project managers above
the _subordinates_, who are users that are assigned to the project manager. One or more _accounts_, can be
assigned to project managers.


**12.7.1** **Defining Project Managers Using Internal User Management**
Any user can be turned into a project manager. If the BCM LDAP server is being used, then the project
manager can be configured via cmsh .


**Example**


**664** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


alice can be made the project manager of bob and charlie . This allows her access to the job data of her
subordinates:


[basecm11->user]% projectmanager alice

[basecm11->user*[alice*]->projectmanager*]% set users bob charlie

[basecm11->user*[alice*]->projectmanager*]% commit


**Example**


albert can be made the manager of the physics account. This gives him access to all jobs running under
that account:


[basecm11->user]% projectmanager albert

[basecm11->user[albert*]->projectmanager*]% set accounts physics

[basecm11->user[albert*]->projectmanager*]% commit


Both mechanisms, users and accounts, can be combined to provide access control.


**Example**


To limit access to jobs that are running under the physics account to a specific set of users:


[basecm11->user]% projectmanager albert

[basecm11->user*[albert*]->projectmanager*]% set accounts physics

[basecm11->user*[albert*]->projectmanager*]% set users niels richard

[basecm11->user*[albert*]->projectmanager*]% set operator and

[basecm11->user*[albert*]->projectmanager*]% commit


**12.7.2** **Defining Project Managers Using External User Management**
If an external user management server is used instead of the BCM LDAP server, then project managers
cannot be defined in cmsh . Instead, a script has to be written that provides the definitions for project
managers in the form of a JSON object.
The full path of the script, for example /path/to/the/script, has to be set as a value to the
ProjectManagerScript parameter in cmd.conf . This is done by adding it to the AdvancedConfig directive (page 862):


**Example**


AdvancedConfig = { "ProjectManagerScript=/path/to/the/script" }


The directive becomes active after restarting CMDaemon.
An example of a project manager script can be found at /cm/local/apps/cmd/scripts/
cm-project-managers.py . It gives users access to each other’s jobs if they share at least one group.
The easiest way to use the script is use a mapping to inform CMDaemon which of the other user’s
jobs each user has access to.


**Example**


So if frank can access data belonging to bob and dennis, while bob can access data belonging to dennis,
while dennis can only access his own data, then the project manager configurations can be set up as:


{

"frank": ["bob", "dennis"],

"bob": ["dennis"],

"dennis": []

}


**12.8 Drilldown Queries For Workload Accounting And Reporting** **665**


Account access control can also be included in the output of the script, by setting values for the
users, accounts, and the boolean operator ( and, or ) options:


**Example**


{

"alice": {

"users": ["charline", "eve"],

"accounts": ["math, "chem"],

"and": True

},

"eve": {

"accounts": ["chem"]

}

}


After restarting CMDaemon, it automatically runs this script when committing a change for a device
or data producer. It is also possible to manually trigger the script to be run on the active head, by
executing:


[root@basecm11 ~]# echo "PROJECT.MANAGERS.UPDATE" > /var/spool/cmd/eventbucket


The script must not take more than a few seconds to process.


**Workaround For Project Manager Script That Takes Too Long**
If the script takes longer to run, then it must be run outside of CMDaemon, and its output should be
saved as a file. If the output file is located at /path/to/the/file, then its path can be set as an input
to the ProjectManagerFile parameter in cmd.conf . This is done by adding it to the AdvancedConfig
directive (page 862):


**Example**


AdvancedConfig = { "ProjectManagerFile=/path/to/the/file" }


The project manager definitions become active after CMDaemon is restarted.


**12.8** **Drilldown Queries For Workload Accounting And Reporting**


Metrics can be classified in various ways. Common ways are by:


  - device: A typical hardware device is a node. Each node can then have its metrics, which are CPU
usage, memory, storage, and other resource use, displayed over time. Device metrics are largely
covered in this chapter in the sections up to and including section 10.8.


  - job: With this classifier, each job that is run by a workload manager can have its metrics, which are
CPU usage, memory, storage and other resource use, displayed over time. Job metrics are covered
in Chapter 11.


Other ways of classifying metrics are part of workload accounting. With workload accounting, a
workload manager runs jobs, and a job metric can be classified by:


  - user


  - job (job ID)


  - account


  - job name


**666** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


The classification can be carried out singly. However, it can also be carried out at the same time, like
filters. For example:


  - each user could be classified for a particular job metric

or


  - a particular user could be classified for a particular job metric

or


  - a particular user could be classifed for a particular job metric for a particular job ID only

or


  - a particular user could be classified for a particular job metric for that particular job ID only for a
particular account only


A cluster administrator that uses several filters to get to the “bottom” of how resources are being
used, functions in a manner reminiscent of someone drilling to the bottom to find something. This type
of filtering is therefore called _drilldown_ . Each filter corresponds to a _level_ of drilldown.
Drilldown is a bit like how in cmsh the use of the filter command within jobs mode can narrow
down what is displayed:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]->jobs]% filter -n iozone -u edgar -a projecty

Job ID Job name User Queue Submit time Start time End time Nodes Exit code

------ -------- ------ ----- ----------- ---------- -------- ----- --------
15 iozone edgar defq 14:22:05 14:50:22 15:00:24 node001 0

19 iozone edgar defq 14:26:07 15:10:25 15:20:19 node001 0

25 iozone edgar defq 14:34:57 15:30:20 15:40:39 node001 0

36 iozone edgar defq 14:43:54 16:10:15 16:19:57 node001 0

41 iozone edgar defq 14:47:24 16:19:57 16:29:42 node001 0


except that in cmsh the value of the job metric is not specified or shown by the filter command.
Drilldown is also rather similar in concept to how pivot tables are used in Excel spreadsheets. Pivot
tables are particular selections (like the filtered choices in drilldown). The selections are applied to a
great deal of raw data. A function (like the metric in drilldown) is applied to the selection, to present
the information more clearly to the end viewer.
In contrast with the filter output of cmsh, in Base View the job metric value is made visible in a table
or in graphs over the period.


**12.8.1** **The** drilldownoverview **Command**

The list of predefined drilldown queries of section 12.3.1 can be listed with the drilldownoverview
command. This can be run from the query submode of the monitoring mode. The output, with some
columns cut out for convenience, looks like:


**Example**


[basecm11->monitoring->query]% drilldownoverview |cut -b1-54,80-143

**668** **Monitoring: Job Accounting**


**12.9** **The** grid **Command For Job Accounting**


A way to carry out job accounting without relying on PromQL queries is the grid command of cmsh .
The grid command can be accessed from within wlm mode for a workload manager. The command
displays the nodes in a grid.
An example of grid output can be seen in the session of page 669.
As seen in that output, the nodes are displayed in a sequence of rows. For each row, the following
row of nodes has the same sequence of nodes, but after an interval of time. Each node in the grid is
displayed as a colored block called a _timeblock_ . The timeblock displays a value for the classifier entity
that the grid command associates with that node. The value for the timeblock is indicated by either its
color, or by text superimposed on that timeblock, or both.


**12.9.1** **The** grid **Command Help Text**
The command options to grid can be looked up in the help text:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]]% help grid

Name:

grid - Show a grid of historic job information


Usage:
grid [options]


Options:
-n, --nodes node(list)

List of nodes, e.g. node001..node015,node020..node028,node030 or ^/some/file/containing/hostnames


...


The classifier entity shown by grid can be called its _mode_, and it can be set with the --mode option.
By default the mode is set to used, which means the classifier entity value displayed for the node is
either that it is being used to run a job, or not being used to run a job.
A help text to describe modes available for a timeblock can be seen with:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]]% grid --mode x

Mode x is not implemented

Valid modes:


used: the node was used in this timeblock

count: the number of jobs using the node in this timeblock

average: the averaged time jobs used the node in this timeblock

user: the user that used the node the most in this timeblock

group: the group that used the node the most in this timeblock

account: the account that used the node the most in this timeblock

job-name: the job-name that used the node the most in this timeblock

job-id: the job-name that used the node the most in this timeblock

count-cpu: the number of requested CPUs on the node in this timeblock

average-cpu: the time averaged of requested CPUs on the node in this timeblock

count-gpu: the number of requested GPUs on the node in this timeblock

average-gpu: the time averaged of requested GPUs on the node in this timeblock


**12.9.2** **Some** grid **Command Examples**
With the grid command, the timeblock value is given a color, and can also be indicated by an associated
text value.


**12.9 The** grid **Command For Job Accounting** **669**


**Displaying Nodes Used**
For example: over intervals of 10 minutes (600 seconds), from 28 hours ago to 27 hours ago, for nodes
node001, node002, node003, the used mode for nodes can be displayed with the command:


**Example**


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]]% grid --after -28h --before -27h --interval 600 -n node001..node003 --text --legend

node001 node002 node003


Not running a job Running a job


The --legend option provides a color legend after the display, and the --text option for this mode
overwrites the timeblock with an associated value of 1.00000 or 0.000000 .

The time specification is explained in detail in section 12.9.3.


**Displaying Users Usage Of Nodes**
Another example, which displays users that used the node the most, and their usage as a percentage,
per timeblock of 600s, over a time from 5370 minutes in the past to 5350 minutes in the past:


[basecm11->wlm[slurm]]% grid --mode user --after -5370m --before -5350m -n node001..node003 --interval 600 _\_

--text --legend

node001 node002 node003





joe eve bob carol hugh dennis

[basecm11->wlm[slurm]]%


The display percentage can be disabled with the -no-percent option.


**Displaying Larger Numbers Of Nodes**
For larger clusters, the administrator can view the grid output over a larger monitor, or over several
monitors, and perhaps using higher resolutions to get a colour map. Figure 12.7 shows an output for
128 nodes:

The watch command of cmsh can be used to display updates as the cluster is used during the day,
[without requiring input from the cluster administrator. Patterns of use may be viewed in this manner.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-GTcHZkfCs)
For example, the black parts of node rows in figure 12.7 are a visual indication of times when those
nodes were not used.


**12.9.3** **The** grid **Command Time Specification**
The grid command time specification is identical to that of the dumpmonitoringdata command (section 10.6.4), except that dumpmonitoringdata has implicit mandatory arguments. The time specifications
for grid are, on the other hand, done explicitly, and use the time options and arguments:


 - --before < _end-time_  

and


 - --after < _start-time_  

The syntax for the time specifications of grid is also used by the statistics and filter commands.
The time options --after (mnemonic: aFTter=From Time) and --before (mnemonic: befOre=tO)
can have their arguments specified as follows:


 - _Fixed time format_ : The format for the times that make up the time pair can be:


**–**
[YY/MM/DD] HH:MM[:SS]
(If YY/MM/DD is used, then each time must be enclosed in double quotes)


**–**
The unix epoch time (seconds since 00:00:00 1 January 1970)


 - now : For the --before option, a value of now can be set. The time at which the grid command is
run is then used.


 - _Relative time format_ : One item in the time pair can be set to a fixed time format. The other item in
the time pair can then have its time set relative to the fixed time item. The format for the non-fixed
time item (the relative time item) can then be specified as follows:


**–** For the < _start-time_    -, a number prefixed with “-” is used. It indicates a time that much earlier
than the fixed end time.


**–** For the < _end-time_    -, a number prefixed with “+” is used. It indicates a time that much later
than the fixed start time.


**–** The number values also have suffix values indicating the units of time, as seconds ( s ), minutes
( m ), hours ( h ), or days ( d ).


**12.9 The** grid **Command For Job Accounting** **671**


The relative time format is summarized in the following table:


**Unit** < _start-time_    - < _end-time_    

seconds: -< _number_ >s +< _number_ >s


minutes: -< _number_ >m +< _number_ >m


hours: -< _number_ >h +< _number_ >h


days: -< _number_ >d +< _number_ >d


  - Both < _start-time_  - and < _end-time_  - can have their values prefixed with a “-”. In this case, the range
over which the monitored values are seen is in the past, relative to the current time. If the end
time for the range is specified as further in the past than the starting time, then the time values are
swapped over so that the end time becomes more recent than the starting time.
