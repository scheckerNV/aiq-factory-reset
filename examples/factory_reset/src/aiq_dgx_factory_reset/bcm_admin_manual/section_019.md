**Topmost Part**

- hosts: all #(1)

gather_facts: false #(2)


1. This is a standard Ansible playbook configuration item. It defines the group or host that the
playbook is run on.


2. Fact gathering is skipped here, because there is no need to use any facts that Ansible usually
gathers pre-playbook-run. As a bonus, skipping it makes execution faster.


**Pre_tasks Part**
The pre_tasks section could have been made a part of the tasks section. However, making it a separate
section has the benefit of separating real action from simple fact definition:


  - name: set compute nodes for site

set_fact:


**14.10 Ansible And NVIDIA Base Command Manager** **735**


site_compute_nodes: "{{nodes | map(attribute='hostname') | list}}" #(1)


  - name: set nodes for site

set_fact:

site_nodes: "{{[director.hostname] + site_compute_nodes}}" #(2)


1. In the preceding code, the Ansible templating capability is used to get the list of compute_nodes for
the site that is to be created. The hostname attribute is extracted from every element of the nodes
variable and then transformed into a list, and assigned to the site_compute_nodes variable.


2. The list that is created has all the nodes that are part of the site, which means the compute nodes
as well as the director.


**The Tasks Part**

**External and internal networks configuration:** The tasks section starts with networking definitions
(tagged here with (1) and (2)). These are the external and internal networks that are needed for the edge
site that is to be created.


  - name: create an external network #(1)

brightcomputing.bcm110.network:

state: present

baseAddress: 10.152.0.0

  - name: create an internal network #(2)

brightcomputing.bcm110.network:

dynamicRangeEnd: 10.161.19.255

netmaskBits: 16

domainName: test-site-internal_network

management: true

bootable: true


The possible values for each entity attribute can be seen by running the ansible-doc command:


**Example**


$ ansible-doc brightcomputing.bcm110.network


**Director creation:** A category must exist for the edge director, or must be created before the director
can be created. The following snippet takes care of that:


  - name: create edge site software image

brightcomputing.bcm110.software_image:

name: my-software-image
path: /cm/images/my-software-image


**736** **Day-to-day Administration**

mountpoint: /cm/shared

filesystem: nfs

     - device: $localnfsserver:/home

mountpoint: /home

filesystem: nfs
state: present #(4)


1. The cloneFrom attribute is used to create the new software image from the existing one, to avoid
copying over all the values that are part of the original image. The default-image is used here,
since it is guaranteed to be defined in a new cluster.


The cloneFrom attribute only takes effect when the resource is not defined. This means that if the
software image is already present, then using cloneFrom has no effect. Removing the image allows
it to be re-created again using the cloneFrom attribute.


2. The declared software image (here it is my-software-image ) is then used to define the director
category.


3. The edge directory category attributes in the snippet are standard values that are normally assigned to a director category that is to be used by director nodes.


4. The default value for state is present, so the task has the same behavior if the state field is left

out.


**Values for the director node:** The edge director node values can now be set


  - name: create director physical node

brightcomputing.bcm110.physical_node:

state: present

hostname: "{{director.hostname}}"

partition: base

interfaces_NetworkPhysicalInterface:

     - name: eth0

allowRamdiskCreation: true

roles_StorageRole:

     - name: storage_role

roles_ProvisioningRole:

     - name: provisioning_role

allImages: LOCALDISK


In the preceding snippet, values are set for the physical node so that it functions correctly as a director
on an edge site.


1. The director, just like the edge nodes, is just a physical node, with the role EdgeDirectorRole
assigned to it, along with other relevant roles.


**The edge (compute) nodes definition:**


1. In the following snippet, the looping mechanism defines a physical node that corresponds to each
declared compute node.


Each edge node belongs to the correct network.


  - name: create edge nodes

brightcomputing.bcm110.physical_node:

hostname: "{{item.hostname}}"

softwareImageProxy:

parentSoftwareImage: default-image

interfaces_NetworkPhysicalInterface:

     - name: eth0

ip: "{{item.eth0_ip}}"

category: default

mac: "{{item.mac}}"

managementNetwork: test-site-internal_network

installBootRecord: false

provisioningInterface: eth0

partition: base
loop: "{{ nodes }}" #(1)


**Edge site object creation:** The last part of the playbook creates the edge site object.


  - name: add test edge site

brightcomputing.bcm110.edge_site:

name: "{{site.name}}"

secret: "{{site.secret}}"

address: Springfield

adminEmail: admin-west@email.com

city: San Francisco

contact: Admin

country: USA

notes: Note about the site

state: present

nodes: "{{site_nodes}}" #(1)


**738** **Day-to-day Administration**


The site_nodes variable, defined by the set_fact task, is assigned to the nodes attribute of an edge_site
action.

Running this playbook on a fresh cluster should be enough to create a new edge site with the declared
properties, even if the nodes are not physically present.
The state of the edge site can be checked with cmsh queries. It should be noted that the image creation
step may take a few minutes, depending on how big default-image is.

### **High Availability**

**15.0** **Introduction**


**15.0.1** **Why Have High Availability?**
In a cluster with a single head node, the head node is a single point of failure for the entire cluster. It is
often unacceptable that the failure of a single machine can disrupt the daily operations of a cluster.
High availablity configuration for a head node is about configuring an extra head node to provide
the head node services in a redundant manner. If one head node fails, then the other head node can take
over, thus providing the same services with a minimum of downtime.
High availability can be set up for other types of nodes too.


**15.0.2** **High Availability—For What Nodes?**
By default, in this and other chapters, HA is about a head node failover configuration. When it is
otherwise, then it is made explicitly clear in the manuals that it is regular node HA, or edge director
HA, or COD head node HA that is being discussed.


**High Availability For Head Nodes**
By default, the head node usually runs the most services. The high availability (HA) feature of BCM
therefore allows clusters to be set up with two head nodes configured as a failover pair, with one member
of the pair being the active head. The purpose of this design is to increase availability to beyond that
provided by a single head node.


**High Availability For Regular Nodes**
Especially with smaller clusters, it is often convenient to run all services on the head node. However, an
administrator may want or need to run a service on a regular node instead. For example, a workload
manager, or NFS could be run on a regular node. If a service disruption is unacceptable here, too, then
HA can be configured for regular nodes too (section 15.5). HA for regular nodes is a more recent feature
in BCM, and is done differently compared with head nodes.


**High Availability For Edge Directors**
Edge directors manage edge nodes and manage them in a similar way to how head nodes manage regular nodes. Also similar to head nodes is that edge directors can also be configured for HA (section 2.1.1
of the _Edge Manual_ ). However, their HA design is based on that of HA for regular nodes.


**High Availability For COD Head Nodes**
Cluster On Demand (COD) head nodes are head nodes that run on a cloud service provider. COD HA
head nodes are very similar to standard cluster HA (on-premises) head nodes. COD HA is discussed
separately in section 2.14 of the _Cloudbursting Manual_ .


**740** **High Availability**


**15.0.3** **High Availability Usually Uses Shared Storage**
HA is typically configured using shared storage (section 15.1.5), such as from an NFS service, which
typically provides the /home directory on the active (section 15.1.1) head, and on the regular nodes.


**15.0.4** **Organization Of This Chapter**
The remaining sections of this chapter are organized as follows:


 - **HA On Head Nodes**


**–**
Section 15.1 describes the concepts behind HA, keeping the BCM configuration in mind.


**–**
Section 15.2 describes the normal user-interactive way in which the BCM implementation of
a failover setup is configured.


**–**
Section 15.3 describes the implementation of the BCM failover setup in a less user-interactive
way, which avoids using the ncurses dialogs of section 15.2


**–**
Section 15.4 describes how HA is managed with BCM after it has been set up.


 - **HA On Regular Nodes**


**–**
Section 15.5 describes the concepts behind HA for regular nodes, and how to configure HA
for them.


 - **HA And Workload Manager Jobs**


**–**
Section 15.6 describes the support for workload manager job continuation during HA failover.


**15.1** **HA Concepts**


**15.1.1** **Primary, Secondary, Active, Passive**
**Naming:** In a cluster with an HA setup, one of the head nodes is named the _primary_ head node and
the other head node is named the _secondary_ head node.


**Mode:** Under normal operation, one of the two head nodes is in _active_ mode, whereas the other is in
_passive_ mode.
The difference between naming versus mode is illustrated by realizing that while a head node which
is primary always remains primary, the mode that the node is in may change. Thus, the primary head
node can be in passive mode when the secondary is in active mode. Similarly the primary head node
may be in active mode while the secondary head node is in passive mode. As an aside: the definition
for primary in HA for NVIDIA Base Command Manager should not be confused with the definition
for primary that is used by workload managers such as Slurm and PBS Professional when a failover
mechanism is configured by the workload manager (section 7.2.4).
The difference between active and passive is that the active head takes the lead in cluster-related
activity, while the passive follows it. Thus, for example, with MySQL transactions, CMDaemon carries them out with MySQL running on the active, while the passive trails the changes. This naturally
means that the active corresponds to the master, and the passive to the slave, in the MySQL master-slave
replication mode that MySQL is run as.


**15.1.2** **Monitoring The Active Head Node, Initiating Failover**
In HA the passive head node continuously monitors the active head node. If the passive finds that the
active is no longer operational, it will initiate a _failover sequence_ . A failover sequence involves taking over
resources, services and network addresses from the active head node. The goal is to continue providing
services to compute nodes, so that jobs running on these nodes keep running.


**15.1 HA Concepts** **741**


**15.1.3** **Services In BCM HA Setups**
There are several services being offered by a head node to the cluster and its users.


**Services Running On Both Head Nodes**
One of the design features of the HA implementation in BCM is that whenever possible, services are
offered on both the active as well as the passive head node. This allows the capacity of both machines
to be used for certain tasks (e.g. provisioning), but it also means that there are fewer services to move in
the event of a failover sequence.
On a default HA setup, the following key services for cluster operations are always running on both
head nodes:


 - **CMDaemon** : providing certain functionality on both head nodes (e.g. provisioning)


 - **DHCP** : load balanced setup


 - **TFTP** : requests answered on demand, under xinetd


 - **LDAP** : running in replication mode (the active head node LDAP database is pulled by the passive)


 - **MySQL** : running in master-slave replication mode (the active head node MySQL database is
pulled by the passive)


 - **NTP**


 - **DNS**


 - **Workload Management** : For each of the Slurm, PBS, LSF services, one WLM is fully active on one
head node, while the other head node has WLM components on a passive standby


When an HA setup is created from a single head node setup, the above services are automatically
reconfigured to run in the HA environment over two head nodes.


**Provisioning role runs on both head nodes** In addition, both head nodes also take up the _provisioning_
_role_, which means that nodes can be provisioned from both head nodes. As the passive head node is then
also provisioned from the active, and the active can switch between primary and secondary, it means
both heads are also given a value for provisioninginterface (section 5.4.7).
For a head node in a single-headed setup, there is no value set by default. For head nodes in an HA
setup, the value of provisioninginterface for each head node is automatically set up by default to the
interface device name over which the image can be received when the head node is passive.
The implications of running a cluster with multiple provisioning nodes are described in detail in
section 5.2. One important aspect described in that section is how to make provisioning nodes aware of
image changes.
From the administrator’s point of view, achieving awareness of image changes for provisioning
nodes in HA clusters is dealt with in the same way as for single-headed clusters. Thus, if using cmsh,
the updateprovisioners command from within softwareimage mode is used, whereas if Base View
is used, then the navigation path Provisioning - Provisioning requests - Update provisioning
nodes can be followed (section 5.2.4).


**Services That Migrate To The Active Node**
Although it is possible to configure any service to migrate (become active) from one head node to another in the event of a failover, in a typical HA setup only the following services migrate:


 - NFS


  - The User Portal


**742** **High Availability**


  - Workload management:


**–** The Slurm DBD accounting daemon ( slurmdbd )


**–** The PBS dataservice and PBS scheduler ( pbs_ds_monitor and pbs_sched )


**–** The LSF management batch daemon ( mbatchd ), external load information managers ( elim.* ),
external authentication ( eauth ), and batch scheduling manager ( mbschd )


**15.1.4** **Failover Network Topology**
A two-head failover network layout is illustrated in figure 15.1.

Figure 15.1: High Availability: Two-Head Failover Network Topology


In the illustration, the primary head1 is originally a head node before the failover design is implemented. It is originally set up as part of a Type 1 network (section 3.3.9 of the _Installation Manual_ ), with
an internal interface eth0, and an external interface eth1.
When the secondary head is connected up to help form the failover system, several changes are
made.


**15.1 HA Concepts** **743**


**HA: Network Interfaces**

Each head node in an HA setup typically has at least an external and an internal network interface, each
configured with an IP address.
In addition, an HA setup uses two virtual IP interfaces, each of which has an associated virtual IP
address: the external shared IP address and the internal shared IP address. These are shared between

the head nodes, but only one head node can host the address and its interface at any time.
In a normal HA setup, a shared IP address has its interface hosted on the head node that is operating
in active mode. On failover, the interface migrates and is hosted on the head node that then becomes
active.

When head nodes are also being used as login nodes, users outside of the cluster are encouraged
to use the shared external IP address for connecting to the cluster. This ensures that they always reach
whichever head node is active. Similarly, inside the cluster, nodes use the shared internal IP address
wherever possible for referring to the head node. For example, nodes mount NFS filesystems on the
shared internal IP interface so that the imported filesystems continue to be accessible in the event of a
failover.

Shared interfaces are implemented as alias interfaces on the physical interfaces (e.g. eth0:0 ). They
are activated when a head node becomes active, and deactivated when a head node becomes passive.


**HA: Dedicated Failover Network**

In addition to the normal internal and external network interfaces on both head nodes, the two head
nodes are usually also connected using a direct dedicated network connection, eth2 in figure 15.1. This
connection is used between the two head nodes to monitor their counterpart’s availability. It is called a
_heartbeat_ connection because the monitoring is usually done with a regular heartbeat-like signal between
the nodes such as a ping, and if the signal is not detected, it suggests a head node is dead.
To set up a failover network, it is highly recommended to simply run a UTP cable directly from the
NIC of one head node to the NIC of the other, because not using a switch means there is no disruption
of the connection in the event of a switch reset.


**15.1.5** **Shared Storage**
Almost any HA setup also involves some form of shared storage between two head nodes to preserve
state after a failover sequence. For example, user home directories must always be available to the
cluster in the event of a failover.

In the most common HA setup, the following two directories are shared:


 - /home, the user home directories


 - /cm/shared, the shared tree containing applications and libraries that are made available to the
nodes


The shared filesystems are only available on the active head node. For this reason, it is generally
recommended that users log in via the shared IP address, rather than ever using the direct primary
or secondary IP address. End-users logging into the passive head node by direct login may run into
confusing behavior due to unmounted filesystems.
BCM versions 11.0 and beyond use NAS (Network Attached Storage) for shared storage. Versions
prior to 11.0 also allowed DAS (Direct Attached Storage) for shared storage. However, DAS by its
very nature has drawbacks that make it significantly more fragile for shared storage purposes. DAS is
therefore no longer suggested as a possible shared storage option for BCM.


**NAS**

In a Network Attached Storage (NAS) setup, both head nodes mount a shared volume from an external
network attached storage device. In the most common situation this would be an NFS server either
inside or outside of the cluster. Lustre or GPFS storage are other popular choices.
Because imported mounts can typically not be re-exported (which is true at least for NFS), nodes
typically mount filesystems directly from the NAS device.


**744** **High Availability**


**Custom Shared Storage With Mount And Unmount Scripts**
The cluster management daemon on the two head nodes deals with shared storage through a _mount_
_script_ and an _unmount script_ . When a head node is moving to active mode, it must acquire the shared
filesystems. To accomplish this, the other head node first needs to relinquish any shared filesystems that
may still be mounted. After this has been done, the head node that is moving to active mode invokes
the _mount script_ which has been configured during the HA setup procedure. When an active head node
is requested to become _passive_ (e.g. because the administrator wants to take it down for maintenance
without disrupting jobs), the _unmount script_ is invoked to release all shared filesystems.
By customizing the _mount_ and _unmount_ scripts, an administrator has full control over the form of
shared storage that is used. Also an administrator can control which filesystems are shared.
Mount scripts paths can be set via cmsh or Base View (section 15.4.6).


**15.1.6** **Guaranteeing One Active Head At All Times**
Because of the risks involved in accessing a shared filesystem simultaneously from two head nodes, it is
vital that only one head node is in active mode at any time. To guarantee that a head node that is about
to switch to active mode will be the only head node in active mode, it must either receive confirmation
from the other head node that it is in passive mode, or it must make sure that the other head node is
powered off.


**What Is A Split Brain?**
When the passive head node determines that the active head node is no longer reachable, it must also
take into consideration that there could be a communication disruption between the two head nodes.
Because the “brains” of the cluster are communicatively “split” from each other, this is called a _split brain_
situation.

Since the normal communication channel between the passive and active may not be working correctly, it is not possible to use only that channel to determine either an inactive head or a split brain with
certainty. It can only be suspected.
Thus, on the one hand, it is possible that the head node has, for example, completely crashed, becoming totally inactive and thereby causing the lack of response. On the other hand, it is also possible
that, for example, a switch between both head nodes is malfunctioning, and that the active head node is
still up and running, looking after the cluster as usual, and that the head node in turn observes that the
passive head node seems to have split away from the network.
Further supporting evidence from the dedicated failover network channel is therefore helpful. Some
administrators find this supporting evidence an acceptable level of certainty, and configure the cluster
to decide to automatically proceed with the failover sequence, while others may instead wish to examine the situation first before manually proceeding with the failover sequence. The implementation of
automatic vs manual failover is described in section 15.1.7. In either implementation, _fencing_, described
next, takes place until the formerly active node is powered off.


**Going Into Fencing Mode**
To deal with a suspected inactive head or split brain, a passive head node that notices that its active
counterpart is no longer responding, first goes into _fencing_ mode from that time onward. While a node
is fencing, it will try to obtain proof via another method that its counterpart is indeed inactive.
Fencing, incidentally, does not refer to a thrust-and-parry imagery derived from fencing swordplay.
Instead, it refers to the way all subsequent actions are tagged and effectively fenced-off as a backlog of
actions to be carried out later. If the head nodes are able to communicate with each other before the

passive decides that its counterpart is now inactive, then the fenced-off backlog is compared and synced
until the head nodes are once again consistent.


**Ensuring That The Unresponsive Active Is Indeed Inactive**
There are two ways in which “proof” can be obtained that an unresponsive active is inactive:


1. By asking the administrator to manually confirm that the active head node is indeed powered off


**15.1 HA Concepts** **745**


2. By performing a power-off operation on the active head node, and then checking that the power
is indeed off to the server. This is also referred to as a STONITH (Shoot The Other Node In The
Head) procedure


It should be noted that just pulling out the power cable is not the same as a power-off operation
(section 15.2.4).
Once a guarantee has been obtained that the active head node is powered off, the fencing head node
(i.e. the previously passive head node) moves to active mode.


**Improving The Decision To Initiate A Failover With A Quorum Process**
While the preceding approach guarantees one active head, a problem remains.
In situations where the passive head node loses its connectivity to the active head node, but the
active head node is communicating without a problem to the entire cluster, there is no reason to initiate
a failover. It can even result in undesirable situations where the cluster is rendered unusable if, for
example, a passive head node decides to power down an active head node just because the passive
head node is unable to communicate with any of the outside world (except for the PDU feeding the
active head node).
One technique used by BCM to reduce the chances of a passive head node powering off an active
head node unnecessarily is to have the passive head node carry out a quorum procedure. All nodes
in the cluster are asked by the passive node to confirm that they also cannot communicate with the
active head node. If more than half of the total number of nodes confirm that they are also unable to
communicate with the active head node, then the passive head node initiates the STONITH procedure
and moves to active mode.


**15.1.7** **Automatic Vs Manual Failover**

Administrators have a choice between creating an HA setup with automatic or manual failover.


  - In the case of an automatic failover, an active head node is powered off when it is no longer
responding at all, and a failover sequence is initiated automatically.


  - In the case of a manual failover, the administrator is responsible for initiating the failover when the
active head node is no longer responding. No automatic power off is done, so the administrator is
asked to confirm that the previously active node is powered off.


For automatic failover to be possible, power control must be defined for both head nodes. If power
control is defined for the head nodes, then automatic failover is attempted by default.
The administrator may disable automatic failover. In cmsh this is done by setting the
disableautomaticfailover property, which is a part of the HA-related parameters (section 15.4.6):


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% partition failover base

[basecm11->partition[base]->failover]% set disableautomaticfailover yes

[basecm11->partition*[base*]->failover*]% commit


With Base View it is carried out via the navigation path Cluster  - Partition[base]  - Settings

- Failover - Disable automatic failover

If no power control has been defined, or if automatic failover has been disabled, or if the power
control mechanism is not working (for example due to inappropriate, broken or missing electronics or
hardware), then a failover sequence must always be initiated manually by the administrator.
Sometimes, if automatic failover is enabled, but the active head is still slightly responsive (the socalled _mostly dead_ state, described in section 15.4.2), then the failover sequence must also be initiated
manually by the administrator.


**746** **High Availability**


**15.1.8** **HA And Cloud Nodes**

As far as the administrator is concerned, HA setup remains the same whether a Cluster Extension (Chapter 3 of the _Cloudbursting Manual_ ) is configured or not, and whether a Cluster On Demand (Chapter 2 of
the _Cloudbursting Manual_ ) is configured or not. Behind the scenes, on failover, any networks associated
with the cloud requirements are taken care of by BCM.


**15.1.9** **HA Using Virtual Head Nodes**
Two physical servers are typically used for HA configurations. However, each head node can also be a
virtual machine (VM). The use case for this might be to gain experience with an HA configuration.


**Failover Network Considerations With HA VMs**

With physical head nodes in an HA configuration, the failover network, used for HA heartbeats, is
typically provided by running a network cable directly between the ethernet port on each machine. Not
having even a switch in between is a best practice. Since the head nodes are typically in the same, or
adjacent racks, setting this up is usually straightforward.
With VMs as head nodes in an HA configuration, however, setting up the failover network can be
more complex:


  - The cluster administrator may need to consider if HA is truly improved by, for example, connecting the failover network of the physical node to a switch.


  - Often a virtual switch would be used between the virtual head nodes, just because it is often easier.


  - Not using a failover network is also an option, just as in the physical case.


  - If one head node is on one hypervisor, and another is on a second hypervisor, then a standard
BCM setup cannot have one head node carry out an automated failover STONITH because it
cannot contact the other hypervisor. So powering off the VM in the other hypervisor would have
to be done manually. An alternative to this, if automated failover is required, is to create custom
power scripts.


There are no specific guidelines for the network configuration of HA with VMs in BCM. The process of
configuration is however essentially the same as for a physical node.


**Size Considerations With HA VMs**

A virtual head node in practice may be configured with fewer CPUs and memory than a physical head
node, just because such configurations are more common options in a VM setup than for a physical
setup, and cheaper to run. However, the storage requirement is the same as for a physical node. The
important requirement is that the head nodes should have sufficient resources for the cluster.


**15.2** **HA Setup Procedure Using** cmha-setup


After installation (Chapter 3 of the _Installation Manual_ ) and license activation (Chapter 4 of the _Installation_
_Manual_ ) an administrator may wish to add a new head node, and convert BCM from managing an
existing single-headed cluster to managing an HA cluster.


**Is An HA-Enabled License Required?**
To convert a single-headed cluster to an HA cluster, the existing cluster license should first be checked
to see if it allows HA. The verify-license command run with the info option can reveal this in the
MAC address field:


**Example**


verify-license info | grep ^MAC


**15.2 HA Setup Procedure Using** cmha-setup **747**


HA-enabled clusters display two MAC addresses in the output. Single-headed clusters show only one.
If an HA license is not present, it should be obtained from a BCM reseller, and then be activated and
installed (Chapter 4 of the _Installation Manual_ ).


**Existing User Certificates Become Invalid**
Installing the new license means that any existing user certificates will lose their validity (page 63 of the
_Installation Manual_ ) on Base View session logout. This means:


  - If LDAP is managed by BCM, then on logout, new user certificates are generated, and a new Base
View login session picks up the new certificates automatically.


  - For LDAPs other than that of BCM, the user certificates need to be regenerated.


It is therefore generally good practice to have an HA-enabled license in place before creating user certificates and profiles if there is an intention of moving from a single-headed to an HA-enabled cluster
later on.


**The** cmha-setup **Utility For Configuring HA**
The cmha-setup utility is a special tool that guides the administrator in building an HA setup from a
single head cluster. It is not part of the cluster manager itself, but is a cluster manager tool that interacts
with the cluster management environment by using cmsh to create an HA setup. Although it is in theory
also possible to create an HA setup manually, using either Base View or cmsh along with additional steps,
this is not supported, and should not be attempted as it is error-prone.
A basic HA setup is created in three stages:


1. **Preparation** (section 15.2.1): the configuration parameters are set for the shared interface and for
the secondary head node that is about to be installed.


2. **Cloning** (section 15.2.2): the secondary head node is installed by cloning it from the primary head
node.


3. **Shared Storage Setup** (section 15.2.3): the method for shared storage is chosen and set up.


An optional extra stage is:


4. **Automated Failover Setup** (section 15.2.4): Power control to allow automated failover is set up.


**15.2.1** **Preparation**
The following steps prepare the primary head node for the cloning of the secondary. The preparation is
done only on the primary, so that the presence of the secondary is not actually needed during this stage.


0. It is recommended that all nodes except for the primary head node are powered off, in order to
simplify matters. The nodes should in any case be power cycled or powered back on after the
basic HA setup stages (sections 15.2.1-15.2.3, and possibly section 15.2.4) are complete.


1. If bonding (section 3.5) is to be used on the head node used in an HA setup, then it is recommended
to configure and test out bonding properly before carrying out the HA setup.


2. To start the HA setup, the cmha-setup command is run from a root shell on the primary head
node.


3. Setup is selected from the main menu (figure 15.2).


4. Configure is selected from the Setup menu.


5. A license check is done. Only if successful does the setup proceed further. If the cluster has
no HA-enabled license, a new HA-enabled license must first be obtained from the NVIDIA Base
Command Manager reseller, and activated (section 4.3 of the _Installation Manual_ ).


**748** **High Availability**


Figure 15.2: cmha-setup Main menu


6. The virtual shared internal alias interface name and virtual shared internal IP alias address are set.


7. The virtual shared external alias interface name and virtual shared external IP alias address are

set. For the external shared virtual IP address as well as for the external regular IP addresses,
each head node external interface address must be a static IP addresses for the HA configuration.
Attempting to use DHCP for external addresses in HA is not going to work.


8. The host name of the passive is set.


9. Failover network parameters are set. The failover network physical interface should exist, but the
interface need not be up. The network name, its base address, its netmask, and domain name are
set. This is the network used for optional heartbeat monitoring.


10. Failover network interfaces have their name and IP address set for the active and passive nodes.


11. The primary head node may have other network interfaces (e.g. InfiniBand interfaces, a BMC
interface, alias interface on the BMC network). These interfaces are also created on the secondary
head node, but the IP address of the interfaces still need to be configured. For each such interface,
when prompted, a unique IP address for the secondary head node is configured.


12. The network interfaces of the secondary head node are reviewed and can be adjusted as required.
DHCP assignments on external interfaces can be set by setting the value DHCP . If the primary head
node has a DHCP-assigned IP address, then the input field for the secondary head node is set by
default to the value DHCP .


13. A summary screen displays the planned failover configuration. If alterations need to be made,
they can be done via the next step.


14. The administrator is prompted to set the planned failover configuration. If it is not set, the main
menu of cmha-setup is re-displayed.


15. If the option to set the planned failover configuration is chosen, then a password for the MySQL
root user is requested. The procedure continues further after the password is entered.


16. Setup progress for the planned configuration is displayed (figure 15.3).


**15.2 HA Setup Procedure Using** cmha-setup **749**


Figure 15.3: cmha-setup Setup Progress For Planned Configuration


17. Instructions on what to run on the secondary to clone it from the primary are displayed (figure 15.4).


Figure 15.4: cmha-setup Instructions To Run On Secondary For Cloning


**15.2.2** **Failover Cloning (Replacing A Passive Head)**
In the IT industry, if an image is made of a computer, then it means making a copy of the drive. In BCM
the word “image” is normally used for the software that can be placed on regular nodes. So, BCM uses
the word “cloning” to describe making a very similar, or even identical, copy of a head node, using the
/cm/cm-clone-install command.
There are actually two kinds of cloning possible with the /cm/cm-clone-install command:


 - **Failover cloning** : With this, a passive head node can be created from the active head node. This
uses the --failover option to create a copy that is very similar to the active head node, but with
changes to make it a passive head, ready for failover purposes, and replacing a head that has just
failed.


**750** **High Availability**


 - **Re-cloning** : An active head node can be created from the active head node. This uses the --clone
option to create an exact copy (re-clone) of the head node. This might be useful if for some reason
the administrator would like to take a snapshot of the head node at that moment. Using this
snapshot to have a plug-in replacement head node—that is, a head node kept aside, and ready to
replace a failed production head node later on—is not recommended, due to how impractical it is
to update the snapshot.


The process described in this section PXE boots the passive from the active, thereby loading a special
rescue image from the active that allows cloning from the active to the passive to take place. This section
is therefore about failover cloning. How to carry out re-cloning is described in section 15.4.8.
After the preparation has been done by configuring parameters as outlined in section 15.2.1, the
failover cloning of the head nodes is carried out. In the cloning instructions that follow, the active node
refers to the primary node and the passive node refers to the secondary node. However this correlation
is only true for when an HA setup is created for the first time, and it is not necessarily true if head nodes
are replaced later on by cloning.
These cloning instructions may also be repeated later on if a passive head node ever needs to be
replaced, for example, if the hardware is defective (section 15.4.8). In that case the active head node can
be either the primary or secondary.


1. The passive head node is PXE booted off the internal cluster network, from the active head node.
It is highly recommended that the active and passive head nodes have identical hardware configurations. The BIOS clock of the head nodes should match and be set to the local time. Typically, the
BIOS of both head nodes is also configured so that a hard disk boot is attempted first, and a PXE
boot is attempted after a hard disk boot failure, leading to the Cluster Manager PXE Environment
menu of options. This menu has a 5s time-out.


2. In the Cluster Manager PXE Environment menu of the node that is to become a clone, before
the 5s time-out, “ Start Rescue Environment ” is selected to boot the node into a Linux ramdisk

environment.


3. Once the rescue environment has finished booting, a login as root is done. No password is required
(figure 15.5).


**15.2 HA Setup Procedure Using** cmha-setup **751**


Figure 15.5: Login Screen After Booting Passive Into Rescue Mode From Active


4. The following command is executed (figure 15.6) on the node that is to become a failover clone:
/cm/cmcloneinstall --failover


When doing a re-clone as in section 15.4.8, instead of a failover clone, then it is the --clone option
that is used instead of the --failover option.


Figure 15.6: Cloning The Passive From The Active Via A Rescue Mode Session


5. When prompted to enter a network interface to use, the interface that was used to boot from
the internal cluster network (e.g. eth0, eth1, ...) is entered. There is often uncertainty about
what interface name corresponds to what physical port. This can be resolved by switching to
another console and using “ ethtool -p <interface> ”, which makes the NIC corresponding to


**752** **High Availability**


the interface blink.


6. If the provided network interface is correct, a root@master's password prompt appears. The
administrator should enter the root password.


7. An opportunity to view or edit the master disk layout is offered.


8. A confirmation that the contents of the specified disk are to be erased is asked for.


9. The cloning takes place. The “syncing” stage usually takes the most time. Cloning progress can
also be viewed on the active by selecting the “ Install Progress ” option from the Setup menu.
When viewing progress using this option, the display is automatically updated as changes occur.


10. After the cloning process has finished, a prompt at the console of the passive asks if a reboot is to
be carried out. A “ y ” is typed in response to this. The passive node should be set to reboot off its
hard drive. This may require an interrupt during reboot, to enter a change in the BIOS setting, if
for example, the passive node is set to network boot first.


11. Continuing on now on the active head node, Finalize is selected from the Setup menu of
cmha-setup .


12. The MySQL root password is requested. After entering the MySQL password, the progress of the
Finalize procedure is displayed, and the cloning procedure continues.


13. The cloning procedure of cmha-setup pauses to offer the option to reboot the passive. The administrator should accept the reboot option. After reboot, the cloning procedure is complete. The
administrator can then go to the main menu and quit from there or go on to configure “ Shared
Storage ” (section 15.2.3) from there.


A check can already be done at this stage on the failover status of the head nodes with the cmha
command, run from either head node:


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmha status

Node Status: running in active master mode


Failover status:

basecm11* -> master2

failoverping [ OK ]
mysql [ OK ]
ping [ OK ]

status [ OK ]

master2 -> basecm11*

failoverping [ OK ]
mysql [ OK ]
ping [ OK ]

status [ OK ]


Here, the asterisk indicates the active node, and the arrow direction indicates which node was carrying out the status check on the other. The [OK] states for mysql, ping and status indicate that HA
setup completed successfully. The failoverping state uses the dedicated failover network route for its
checks, and starts working as soon as the passive head node has been rebooted.


**15.2.3** **Shared Storage Setup**
After cloning the head node (section 15.2.2), the last basic stage of creating an HA setup is setting up
shared storage.


**15.2 HA Setup Procedure Using** cmha-setup **753**


**NAS**


1. In the cmha-setup main menu, the “ Shared Storage ” option is selected.


2. NAS is selected.


3. The parts of the head node filesystem that are to be copied to the NAS filesystems are selected. By
default, these are /home and /cm/shared as suggested in section 15.1.5. The point in the filesystem where the copying is done is the future mount path to where the NAS will share the shared
filesystem.


An already-configured export that is not shared is disabled in /etc/exports by cmha-setup . This
is done to prevent the creation of stale NFS file handles during a failover. Sharing already-existing
exports is therefore recommended. Storage can however be dealt with in a customized manner
with mount and unmount scripts (page 744).


4. The NFS host name is configured. Also, for each head node filesystem that is to be copied to the
NAS filesystem, there is an associated path on the NAS filesystem where the share is to be served
from. These NFS volume paths are now configured.


5. If the configured NFS filesystems can be correctly mounted from the NAS server, the process of
copying the local filesystems onto the NAS server begins.


**15.2.4** **Automated Failover And Relevant Testing**
A power-off operation on the active head node server does not mean the same as just pulling out the
power cable to the active head node. These actions typically have different effects, and should therefore
not be confused with each other. During the power-off operation, the BMC remains up. However, in
the case of pulling out the power cable, the BMC is typically turned off too. If the BMC is not reachable,
then it means that verifying that the active head has been terminated is uncertain. This is because the
data that CMDaemon can access implies a logical possibility that there is a network failure rather than
a head node failure. CMDaemon therefore does not carry out an automatic failover if the power cable is
pulled out.
For automatic failover to work, the two head nodes must be able to power off their counterpart. This
is done by setting up power control (Chapter 4).


**Testing If Power Control Is Working**
The “ device power status ” command in cmsh can be used to verify that power control is functional:


**Example**


[master1]% device power status -n mycluster1,mycluster2
apc03:21 ............ [ ON ] mycluster1
apc04:18 ............ [ ON ] mycluster2


**Testing The BMC Interface Is Working**
If a BMC (Baseboard Management Controller, section 3.7) such as IPMI or iLO is used for power control,
it is possible that a head node is not able to reach its own BMC interface over the network. This is
especially true when no dedicated BMC network port is used. In this case, cmsh -c "device power
status" reports a failure for the active head node. This does not necessarily mean that the head nodes
cannot reach the BMC interface of their counterpart. Pinging a BMC interface can be used to verify that
the BMC interface of a head node is reachable from its counterpart.


**Example**


Verifying that the BMC interface of mycluster2 is reachable from mycluster1 :


**754** **High Availability**


[root@mycluster1 ~]# ping -c 1 mycluster2.bmc.cluster
PING mycluster2.bmc.cluster (10.148.255.253) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from mycluster2.bmc.cluster (10.148.255.253): icmp_seq=1

ttl=64 time=0.033 ms


Verifying that the BMC interface of mycluster1 is reachable from mycluster2 :


[root@mycluster2 ~]# ping -c 1 mycluster1.bmc.cluster
PING mycluster1.bmc.cluster (10.148.255.254) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from mycluster1.bmc.cluster (10.148.255.254): icmp_seq=1

ttl=64 time=0.028 ms


**Testing Automated Failover Against A Simulated Crash**
A normal (graceful) shutdown of an active head node, does not cause the passive to become active,
because HA assumes a graceful failover means there is no intention to trigger a failover. To carry out
testing of an HA setup with automated failover, it is therefore useful to simulate a kernel crash on one
of the head nodes. The following command crashes a head node instantly:


echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger


After the active head node freezes as a result of the crash, the passive head node powers off the machine that has frozen and switches to active mode. A hard crash like this can cause a database replication
inconsistency when the crashed head node is brought back up and running again, this time passively,
alongside the node that took over. This is normally indicated by a FAILED status for the output of cmha
status for MySQL (section 15.4). Database administration with the dbreclone command (section 15.4)
may therefore be needed to synchronize the databases on both head nodes to a consistent state. Because
dbreclone is a resource-intensive utility, it is best used during a period when there are few or no users.
It is generally only used by administrators when they are instructed to do so by BCM support.
A passive node can also be made active without a crash of the active-until-then node, by using the
“ cmha makeactive ” command on the passive (section 15.4.2). Manually running this is not needed in
the case of a head node crash in a cluster where power management has been set up for the head nodes,
and the automatic failover setting is not disabled.


**15.3** **Running** cmha-setup **Without ncurses, Using An XML Specification**


**15.3.1** **Why Run It Without ncurses?**
The ncurses-based TUI for cmha-setup is normally how administrators should set up a failover configuration.

The express mode of cmha-setup is the command-line interface (CLI) that allows an administrator
to skip the TUI. This is useful, for example, for scripting purposes and speeding deployment. A further convenience is that this mode uses a human-editable XML file to specify the network and storage
definitions for failover.
Running cmha-setup without the TUI still requires some user intervention, such as entering the
root password for MySQL. The intervention required is scriptable with, for example, Expect, and is
minimized if relevant options are specified for cmha-setup from the -x options.


**15.3.2** **The Syntax Of** cmha-setup **Without ncurses**
The express mode ( -x ) options are displayed when “ cmha-setup -h ” is run. The syntax of the -x options is indicated by:


cmha-setup [ -x -c < _configfile_ - [-s < _type_ >] <-i|-f[-r]> [-p < _mysqlrootpassword_ >] ]


The -x options are:


**15.3 Running** cmha-setup **Without ncurses, Using An XML Specification** **755**


 - -c|--config < _configfile_ >: specifies the location of < _configfile_ >, which is the failover configuration
XML file for cmha-setup . The file stores the values to be used for setting up a failover head node.
The recommended location is at /cm/local/apps/cluster-tools/ha/conf/failoverconf.xml .


 - -i|--initialize : prepares a failover setup by setting values in the CMDaemon database to the
values specified in the configuration file. This corresponds to section 15.2.1. The administrator is
prompted for the MySQL root password unless the -p option is used. The -i option of the script
then updates the interfaces in the database, and clones the head node in the CMDaemon database.
After this option in the script is done, the administrator normally carries clones the passive node
from the active, as described in steps 1 to 10 of section 15.2.2.


 - -f|--finalize : After the passive node is cloned as described in steps 1 to 10 of section 15.2.2, the
finalize option is run on the active node to run the non-TUI finalize procedure. This is the non-TUI
version of steps 11 to 13 of section 15.2.2.


_◦_ -r|--finalizereboot : makes the passive reboot after the finalize step completes.


 - -p|--pass < _mysqlrootpassword_ >: specifies the MySQL root password. Leaving this out means the
administrator is prompted to type in the password during a run of the cmha-setup script when
using the -x options.


There is little attempt at validation with the express mode, and invalid entries can cause the command to hang.


**15.3.3** **Example** cmha-setup **Run Without ncurses**

**Preparation And Initialization:**
After shutting down all nodes except for the active head node, a configuration is prepared by the administrator in /cm/local/apps/cluster-tools/ha/conf/failoverconf.xml . The administrator then
runs cmha-setup with the initialization option on the active:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cd /cm/local/apps/cluster-tools/ha/conf

[root@basecm11 conf]# cmha-setup -x -c failoverconf.xml -i

Please enter the mysql root password:
Initializing failover setup on master ..... [ OK ]
Updating shared internal interface ..... [ OK ]
Updating shared external interface ..... [ OK ]
Updating extra shared internal interfaces ..... [ OK ]
Updating failover network ..... [ OK ]
Updating primary master interfaces ..... [ OK ]
Cloning master node ..... [ OK ]
Updating secondary master interfaces ..... [ OK ]
Updating failover network interfaces ..... [ OK ]
Updating Failover Object ..... [ OK ]


The preceding corresponds to the steps in section 15.2.1.


**PXE Booting And Cloning The Passive:**
The passive head node is then booted up via PXE and cloned as described in steps 1 to 10 of section 15.2.2.


**Finalizing On The Active And Rebooting The Passive:**
Then, back on the active head node the administrator continues the session there, by running the finalization option with a reboot option:


[root@basecm11 conf]# cmha-setup -x -c failoverconf.xml -f -r

Please enter the mysql root password:


**756** **High Availability**


Updating secondary master mac address ..... [ OK ]
Initializing failover setup on master2 ..... [ OK ]
Cloning database ..... [ OK ]
Update DB permissions ..... [ OK ]
Checking for dedicated failover network ..... [ OK ]

A reboot has been issued on master2


The preceding corresponds to steps 11 to 13 of section 15.2.2.


**Adding Storage:**
Continuing with the session on the active, setting up a shared storage could be done with:


[root@basecm11 conf]# cmha-setup -x -c failoverconf.xml -s nas


The preceding corresponds to carrying out the NAS procedure of section 15.2.3.


**15.4** **Managing HA**


Once an HA setup has been created, the tools in this section can be used to manage the HA aspects of
the cluster.


**15.4.1** **Changing An Existing Failover Configuration**
Changing an existing failover configuration is usually done most simply by running through the HA
setup procedure of section 15.2 again, with one exception. The exception is that the existing failover
configuration must be removed by using the “ Undo Failover ” menu option between steps 3 and 4 of
the procedure described in section 15.2.1.


**15.4.2** cmha **Utility**
A major command-line utility for interacting with the HA subsystem, for regular nodes as well as for
head nodes, is cmha . It is part of the BCM cluster-tools package. Its usage information is:


[root@mycluster1 ~]# cmha
Usage: cmha < status | makeactive [node] | dbreclone <host> |

nodestatus [name] >


status Retrieve and print high availability status

of head nodes.


nodestatus [groups] Retrieve and print high availability status
of failover [groups] (comma separated list of group

names. If no argument is given, then the status of

all available failover groups is printed.


makeactive [node] Make the current head node the active head node. If

[node] is specified, then make [node] the active
node in the failover group that [node] is part of.


dbreclone <host> Clone MySQL database from this head node to

<host> (hostname of failover head node).


Some of the information and functions of cmha can also be carried out via CMDaemon:


  - For cmsh, the following commands can be run from within the base object in partition mode:


**–** For the head node, the status and makeactive commands are run from within the failover

submode.


**15.4 Managing HA** **757**


**–** For regular nodes the nodestatus and makeactive [node] commands are run from within
the failovergroups submode.


The dbreclone option cannot be carried out in Base View or cmsh because it requires stopping CMDaemon.

The cmha options status, makeactive, and dbreclone are looked at in greater detail next:


cmha status **: Querying HA Status**
Information on the failover status is displayed thus:


**Example**


[root@mycluster1 ~]# cmha status

Node Status: running in active master mode


Failover status:

mycluster1* -> mycluster2
failoverping [ OK ]
mysql [ OK ]
ping [ OK ]

status [ OK ]

mycluster2 -> mycluster1*
failoverping [ OK ]
mysql [ OK ]
ping [ OK ]

status [ OK ]


The  - in the output indicates the head node which is currently active. The status output shows 4
aspects of the HA subsystem from the perspective of each head node:


**HA Status** **Description**


failoverping the other head node is reachable via the dedicated failover network. This failover
ping uses the failover route instead of the internal net route. It uses ICMP ping


mysql MySQL replication status


ping the other head node is reachable over the primary management network. It uses
ICMP ping.


status CMDaemon running on the other head node responds to REST calls


By default, BCM prepares to carry out the failover sequence (the sequence that includes a STONITH)
when all three of ping, failoverping and status are not OK on a head node. If these three are not OK,
then the active node is _all dead_ according to cmha . One way of initiating failover is thus by causing a
system crash (section 15.2.4).
It can typically take about 30s for the cmha status command to output its findings in the case of a
recently crashed head node.


cmha makeactive **: Initiate Failover**

If automatic failover is enabled (section 15.1.7), then the failover sequence attempts to complete automatically if power management is working properly, and the cmha status shows ping, failoverping
and status as failed.

If automatic failover is disabled, then a manual failover operation must be executed to have a failover
operation take place. A manual failover operation can be carried out with the “ cmha makeactive ” command:


**758** **High Availability**


**Example**


To initiate a failover manually:


[root@mycluster2 ~]# cmha makeactive

Proceeding will initiate a failover sequence which will make this node
(mycluster2) the active master.


Are you sure ? [Y/N]

y

Your session ended because: CMDaemon failover, no longer master

mycluster2 became active master, reconnecting your cmsh ...


On successful execution of the command, the former active head node simply continues to run as a
passive head node.
The cmha makeactive command assumes both head nodes have no problems preventing the execution of the command.

One possible problem that can halt manual failover is if nodes are being provisioned by the provisioning subsystem at that time (section 5.2.4). In that case, provisioning should be cancelled by the
cluster administrator before the cmha makeactive command can continue, for example, with cmsh -c
"softwareimage cancelprovisioningrequest -a" (page 268).
For automatic failover no such intervention takes place—provisioning requests are killed when the
active head node is powered off.
Another slightly similar problem that can occur for automatic failover, as well as manual failover,
is the “mostly dead” edge case. This case requires careful consideration before the Are you sure ?
prompt is answered by the cluster administrator.


cmha makeactive **edge case—the mostly dead active:**


  - For a manual failover operation, if the execution of the cmha makeactive command has problems,
then it can mean that there is a problem with the initially active head node being in a sluggish
state. That is, neither fully functioning, nor all dead. The active head node is thus in a state that is
still powered on, but what can be called _mostly dead_ . Mostly dead means slightly alive (not all of
ping, failoverping, and status are FAILED), while all dead means there is only one thing that
can sensibly be done to make sure the cluster keeps running—that is, to make the old passive the
new active.


Making an old passive the new active is only safe if the old active is guaranteed to not come back
as an active head node. This guarantee is set by a STONITH (page 745) for the old active head
node, and results in a former active that is now all dead. STONITH thus guarantees that head
nodes are not in conflict about their active and passive states. STONITH can however still fail in
achieving a clean shutdown when acting on a mostly dead active head node, which can result in
unclean filesystem or database states.


Thus, the mostly dead active head node may still be in the middle of a transaction, so that shutting it down may cause filesystem or database corruption. Making the passive node also active
then in this case carries risks such as mounting filesystems accidentally on both head nodes, or
carrying out database transactions on both nodes. This can also result in filesystem and database
corruption.


It is therefore left to the administrator to examine the situation for corruption risk. The decision is
either to power off a mostly dead head node, i.e. STONITH to make sure it is all dead, or whether
to wait for a recovery to take place. When carrying out a STONITH on the mostly dead active head
node, the administrator must power it off _before_ the passive becomes active for a manual failover
to take place with minimal errors. The cmha dbreclone option may still be needed to restore a
corrupted database after such a power off, after bringing the system back up.


**15.4 Managing HA** **759**


  - For an automated failover configuration, powering off the mostly dead active head node is not
carried out automatically due to the risk of filesystem and database corruption. A mostly dead
active node with automatic failover configuration therefore stays mostly dead either until it recovers, or until the administrator decides to do a STONITH manually to ensure it is all dead. Here,
too, the cmha dbreclone option may still be needed to restore a corrupted database after such a
power off, after bringing the system back up.


cmha dbreclone **: Cloning The CMDaemon Database**
The dbreclone option of cmha clones the CMDaemon state database from the head node on which cmha
runs to the head node specified after the option. It is normally run in order to clone the database from the
active head node to the passive—running it from the passive to the active can cause a loss of database
entries. Running the dbreclone option can be used to retrieve the MySQL CMDaemon state database
tables, if they are, for example, unsalvageably corrupted on the destination node, and the source node
has a known good database state. Because it is resource intensive, it is best run when there are few or
no users. It is typically only used by administrators after being instructed to do so by BCM support.

**15.4.3** **States**

The state a head node is in can be determined in three different ways:


1 By looking at the message being displayed at login time.


**Example**


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Node Status: running in active master mode


--------------------------------------------------------------------

2 By executing cmha status .


**Example**


[root@mycluster ~]# cmha status

Node Status: running in active master mode

...


3 By examining /var/spool/cmd/state .


There are a number of possible states that a head node can be in:


**State** **Description**


INIT Head node is initializing


FENCING Head node is trying to determine whether it should try to become
active


ACTIVE Head node is in active mode


PASSIVE Head node is in passive mode


BECOMEACTIVE Head node is in the process of becoming active


BECOMEPASSIVE Head node is in the process of becoming passive


UNABLETOBECOMEACTIVE Head node tried to become active but failed


ERROR Head node is in error state due to unknown problem


Especially when developing custom mount and unmount scripts, it is quite possible for a head node to
go into the UNABLETOBECOMEACTIVE state. This generally means that the mount and/or unmount script
are not working properly or are returning incorrect exit codes. To debug these situations, it is helpful
to examine the output in /var/log/cmdaemon . The “ cmha makeactive ” shell command can be used to
instruct a head node to become active again.


**15.4.4** **Failover Action Decisions**

A table summarizing the scenarios that decide when a passive head should take over is helpful:


**15.4 Managing HA** **761**


**Reaction**
**Event on active** **Reason**
**on passive**


Reboot Nothing Event is usually an administrator action action.
To make the passive turn active, an administrator would run “ cmha makeactive ” on it.


Shutdown Nothing As above.

other nodes too. If so, then a “power off” command is sent to it. If the command is succesful,
the passive head becomes the new active head.



Active dies Quorum called, may
lead to passive becoming new active


**15.4.5** **Keeping Head Nodes In Sync**

**What Should Be Kept In Sync?**




- It is a best practice to carry out a manual updateprovisioners command on the active head node,
immediately after a regular node software image change has been made.


A successful run of the updateprovisioners command means that in the event of a failover, the
formerly passive head node already has up-to-date regular node software images, which makes
further administration simpler.


The background behind why it is done can be skipped, but it is as follows:


An image on the passive head node, which is a node with a provisioning role, is treated as an
image on any other provisioning node. This means that it eventually synchronizes to a changed
image on the active head node. By default the synchronization happens at midnight, which means
images may remain out-of-date for up to 24 hours. The images being in an out-of-date state should
be viewed as normal, because the timeout period associated with being in an updated state is only
5 minutes by default.


Since the passive head is a provisioning node, it also means that an attempt to provision regular
nodes from it with the changed image will not succeed if it happens too soon after the image
change event on the active head. “Too soon” means within the autoupdate period defined by the
parameter dirtyautoupdatetimeout (page 234).


If on the other hand the autoupdate timeout is exceeded, then by itself this does not lead to the
image on the passive head node becoming synchronized with an image from the active head node.
Such synchronization only takes place as part of regular housekeeping (at midnight by default).


**762** **High Availability**


Or it takes place if a regular node sends a provisioning request to the passive head node, which
can take place during the reboot of the regular node.


This means that the provisioningstatus command commonly shows that the passive head node
image is “out of date”. This may sound alarming to a cluster administrator. However, before the
image gets to be used, it is synced, so in practice the “out of date” warning is not something to be
concerned about.


The synchronization logic just described is followed to reduce the load on the head node. The only
pitfall in this is the case when an administrator changes an image on the active head node, and then
soon after that the passive head node becomes active as part of a failover, without the images having had enough time to synchronize. In that case the formerly passive node ends up with out-ofdate software images. That is why it is a best practice to carry out a manual updateprovisioners
command on the active head immediately after a regular node software image change has been
made.


  - Changes controlled by CMDaemon are synchronized automatically between the CMDaemon
databases to the required extent during failover to the active node.


If the output of cmha status is not OK, then it typically means that the CMDaemon databases
of the active head node and the passive head node are not synchronized. This situation may be
resolved by waiting, typically for several minutes. If the status does not resolve on its own, then
this indicates a more serious problem which should be investigated further.


  - By default, software images are not stored on shared storage, and are synchronized between the
head nodes by CMDaemon.


However, if images are kept on shared storage, then, within the provisioning role (section 5.2.1),
the image-related parameters such as allimages, localimages, and sharedimages, must be adjusted according to the configuration used.


  - If filesystem changes are made on an active head node without using CMDaemon ( cmsh or Base
View), and if the changes are outside the shared filesystem, then these changes should normally
also be made by the administrator on the passive head node. For example:


**–**
RPM installations/updates (section 9.2)


**–**
Applications installed locally


**–** Files (such as drivers or values) placed in the /cm/node-installer/ directory and referred
to by initialize (section 5.4.5) and finalize scripts (section 5.4.11)


**–**
Any other configuration file changes outside of the shared filesystems


The reason behind not syncing everything automatically is to guarantee that a change that breaks a
head node is not accidentally propagated to the passive. This way there is always a running head node.
Otherwise, if automated syncing is used, there is a risk of ending up with two broken head nodes at the
same time.

If the cluster is being built on bare metal, then a sensible way to minimize the amount of work to
be done is to install a single head cluster first. All packages and applications should then be placed,
updated and configured on that single head node until it is in a satisfactory state. Only then should
HA be set up as described in section 15.2, where the cloning of data from the initial head node to the
secondary is described. The result is then that the secondary node gets a well-prepared system with the
effort to prepare it having only been carried out once.


**Avoiding Encounters With The Old Filesystems**
It should be noted that when the shared storage setup is made, the contents of the shared directories (at
that time) are copied over from the local filesystem to the newly created shared filesystems. The shared


**15.4 Managing HA** **763**


filesystems are then mounted on the mountpoints on the active head node, effectively hiding the local

contents.

Since the shared filesystems are only mounted on the active machine, the old filesystem contents
remain visible when a head node is operating in passive mode. Logging into the passive head node
may thus confuse users and is therefore best avoided.


**Updating Services On The Head Nodes And Associated Syncing**
The services running on the head nodes described in section 15.1.3 should also have their packages
updated on both head nodes.
For the services that run simultaneously on the head nodes, such as CMDaemon, DHCP, LDAP,
MySQL, NTP and DNS, their packages should be updated on both head nodes at about the same time.
A suggested procedure is to stop the service on both nodes around the same time, update the service
and ensure that it is restarted.

The provisioning node service is part of the CMDaemon package. The service updates images from
the active head node to all provisioning nodes, including the passive head node, if the administrator
runs the command to update provisioners. How to update provisioners is described in section 15.1.3.
For services that migrate across head nodes during failover, such as NFS, or the sgemaster it is
recommended (but not mandated) to carry out this procedure: the package on the passive node (called
the secondary for the sake of this example) is updated to check for any broken package behavior. The
secondary is then made active with cmha makeactive (section 15.4.2), which automatically migrates
users cleanly off from being serviced by the active to the secondary. The package is then updated on
the primary. If desired, the primary can then be made active again. The reason for recommending this
procedure for services that migrate is that, in case the update has issues, the situation can be inspected
somewhat better with this procedure.


**15.4.6** **High Availability Parameters**
There are several HA-related parameters that can be tuned. Accessing these via Base View is described
in section 15.4.6. In cmsh the settings can be accessed in the failover submode of the base partition.


**Example**


[mycluster1]% partition failover base

[mycluster1->partition[base]->failover]% show

Parameter Value

------------------------------ ---------------------------
Dead time 10

Failover network failovernet

Init dead 30

Keep alive 1

Mount script

Postfailover script

Prefailover script

Quorum time 60

Revision

Secondary headnode

Unmount script

Warn time 5


Dead time

When a passive head node determines that the active head node is not responding to any of the periodic
checks for a period longer than the Dead time seconds, the active head node is considered dead and
a quorum procedure starts. Depending on the outcome of the quorum, a failover sequence may be
initiated.


**764** **High Availability**


Disable automatic failover

Setting this to yes disables automated failover. Section 15.1.7 covers this further.


Failover network

The Failover network setting determines which network is used as a dedicated network for the
failoverping heartbeat check. The heartbeat connection is normally a direct cable from a NIC on one
head node to a NIC on the other head node. The network can be selected via tab-completion suggestions. By default, without a dedicated failover network, the possibilities are nothing, externalnet and

internalnet .


Init dead

When head nodes are booted simultaneously, the standard Dead time might be too strict if one head
node requires a bit more time for booting than the other. For this reason, when a head node boots (or
more exactly, when the cluster management daemon is starting), a time of Init dead seconds is used
rather than the Dead time to determine whether the other node is alive.


Keep alive
The Keep alive value is the time interval, in seconds, over which the passive head node carries out a
check that the active head node is still up. If a dedicated failover network is used, 3 separate heartbeat
checks are carried out to determine if a head node is reachable.


Mount script
The script pointed to by the Mount script setting is responsible for bringing up and mounting the
shared filesystems.


Postfailover script
The script pointed to by the Postfailover script setting is run by cmdaemon on both head nodes. The
script first runs on the head that is now passive, then on the head that is now active. It runs as soon as
the former passive has become active. It is typically used by scripts mounting an NFS shared storage so
that no more than one head node exports a filesystem to NFS clients at a time.


Prefailover script
The script pointed to by the Prefailover script setting is run by cmdaemon on both head nodes. The
script first runs on the (still) active head, then on the (still) passive head. It runs as soon as the decision
for the passive to become active has been made, but before the changes are implemented. It is typically
used by scripts unmounting an NFS shared storage so that no more than one head node exports a
filesystem to NFS clients at a time. When unmounting shared storage, it is very important to ensure
that a non-zero exit code is returned if unmounting has problems, or the storage may become mounted
twice during the Postfailover script stage, resulting in data corruption.


Quorum time
When a node is asked what head nodes it is able to reach over the network, the node has Quorum time
seconds to respond. If a node does not respond to a call for quorum within that time, it is no longer
considered for the results of the quorum check.


Secondary headnode
The Secondary headnode setting is used to define the secondary head node to the cluster.


Unmount script
The script pointed to by the Unmount script setting is responsible for bringing down and unmounting
the shared filesystems.


**15.4 Managing HA** **765**


Warn time

When a passive head node determines that the active head node is not responding to any of the periodic
checks for a period longer than Warn time seconds, a warning is logged that the active head node might
become unreachable soon.


**15.4.7** **Viewing Failover Via Base View**

**Accessing** cmsh **HA Parameters (** partition failover base **) Via Base View**
The Base View equivalents of the cmsh HA parameters in section 15.4.6 are accessed from the navigation
path Cluster - Partition[base] - Settings

- Failover


**15.4.8** **Re-cloning A Head Node**
Some time after an HA setup has gone into production, it may become necessary to re-install one of the
head nodes, for example if one of the head nodes were replaced due to hardware failure.
To re-clone a head node from an existing active head node, the head node hardware that is going to
become the clone can be PXE-booted into the rescue environment, as described in section 15.2.2. Instead
of running the cm-clone-install --failover command as in that section, the following command can
be run:


[root@basecm11 ~]# /cm/cm-clone-install --clone --hostname=< _new host name_ 

The new host name can be the same as the original, because the clone is not run at the same time
as the original anyway. The clone should not be run after cloning on the same network segment as the
original, in order to prevent IP address conflicts.
If the clone is merely intended as a backup, then the clone hardware does not have to match the head
node. For a backup, typically the most important requirement is then that a clone drive should not run
out of space—that is, its drive should be as large as, or larger than the matching drive of the head node.
If the clone is to be put to work as a head node, then, if the MAC address of one of the head nodes
has changed, it is typically necessary to request that the product key is unlocked, so that a new license
can be obtained (section 4.3 of the _Installation Manual_ ).
Also, for a clone that is to be put to work as a head node, the CMDaemon database should first be
synchronized from the active head node to the clone. This can be done by running cmha dbreclone on
the active head node (page 759) before carrying out tasks with cmsh or Base View.


**Exclude Lists And Cloning**
Some files are normally excluded from being copied across from the head node to the clone, because
syncing them is not appropriate.
The following exclude files are read from inside the directory /cm/ on the clone node when the
cm-clone-install command is run (step 4 in section 15.2.2).


 - excludelistnormal : used to exclude files to help generate a clone of the other head node. It is
read when running the cm-clone-install command without the --failover option.


 - excludelistfailover : used to exclude files to help generate a passive head node from an active
head node. It is read when running the cm-clone-install --failover command.


In a default cluster, there is no need to alter these exclude files. However some custom head node
configurations may require appending a path to the list.
The cloning that is carried out is logged in /var/log/clone-install-log .


**Exclude Lists In Perspective**
The exclude lists excludelistfailover and excludelistnormal described in the preceding paragraphs
should not be confused with the exclude lists of section 5.6.1. The exclude lists of section 5.6.1:


**766** **High Availability**


 - excludelistupdate


 - excludelistfullinstall


 - excludelistsyncinstall


 - excludelistgrabnew


 - excludelistgrab


 - excludelistmanipulatescript


are Base View or cmsh options, and are maintained by CMDaemon. On the other hand, the exclude lists
introduced in this section (15.4.8):


 - excludelistfailover


 - excludelistnormal


are not Base View or cmsh options, are not modified with excludelistmanipulatescript, are not maintained by CMDaemon, but are made use of when running the cm-clone-install command.


**Btrfs And** cm-clone-install

If a partition with Btrfs (section 14.4.1) is being cloned using cm-clone-install, then by default only
mounted snapshots are cloned.
If all the snapshots are to be cloned, then the --btrfs-full-clone flag should be passed to the
cm-clone-install command. This flag clones all the snapshots, but it is carried out with duplication
(bypassing the COW method), which means the filesystem size can increase greatly.


**15.5** **HA For Regular Nodes And Edge Director Nodes**


HA for regular nodes is available from NVIDIA Base Command Manager version 7.0 onward. HA for
edge director nodes follows a similar design to HA for regular nodes, and is available from NVIDIA
Base Command Manager version 9.2 onward.


**15.5.1** **Why Have HA On Non-Head Nodes?**

**Why Have HA On Regular Nodes?**
HA for regular nodes can be used to add services to the cluster and make them HA. Migrating the
default existing HA services that run on the head node is not recommended, since these are optimized
and integrated to work well as is. Instead, good candidates for this feature are other, extra, services that
can run, or are already running, on regular nodes, but which benefit from the extra advantage of HA.


**Why Have HA On Edge Director Nodes?**
Edge director nodes manage edge nodes in a similar way to how head nodes manager regular nodes.
Edge directors therefore benefit from HA for the same main that head nodes benefit from HA: avoiding
a single point of failure (section 15.0.1).


**15.5.2** **Comparing HA For Head Nodes, Regular Nodes And Edge Director Nodes**
Many of the features of HA for regular nodes and edge director nodes are as HA for head nodes. These
include:


**15.5 HA For Regular Nodes And Edge Director Nodes** **767**


**HA For Head Nodes, Regular Nodes, And Edge Director Nodes: Some Features In Common**


Power control is needed for all HA nodes, in order to carry out automatic failover (section 15.1.7).


Warn time and dead time parameters can be set (section 15.4.6).


Mount and unmount scripts (page 744).


Pre- and post- failover scripts (section 15.4.6).


Disabling or enabling automatic failover (section 15.1.7).

**Failover Groups**
Regular nodes use _failover groups_ to identify nodes that are grouped for HA. Two or more nodes are
needed for a failover group to function. During normal operation, one member of the failover group is
active, while the rest are passive. A group typically provides a particular service.
Edge directors also use failover groups for HA. However configuration of edge directors is generally
best done during installation with cm-edge-setup (section 2.1.1 of the _Edge Manual_ ).


**15.5.3** **Setting Up A Regular Node HA Service**
In cmsh a regular node HA service, CUPS in this example, can be set up as follows:


**768** **High Availability**


**Making The Failover Group**
A failover group must first be made, if it does not already exist:


**Example**


[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups]% status

No active failover groups

[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups]% add cupsgroup

[basecm11->partition*[base*]->failovergroups*[cupsgroup*]]% list
Name (key) Nodes

------------------------ -----------------------
cupsgroup


By default, CUPS is provided in the standard image, in a stopped state. In Base View a failover group
can be added via the navigation path Cluster - Partition[base] - Settings - Failover groups

- Add


**Adding Nodes To The Failover Group**
Regular nodes can then be added to a failover group. On adding, BCM ensures that one of the nodes in
the failover group becomes designated as the active one in the group (some text elided):


**Example**


[basecm11->...[cupsgroup*]]% set nodes node001..node002

[basecm11->...[cupsgroup*]]% commit

[basecm11->...[cupsgroup]]%

...Failover group cupsgroup, make node001 become active

...Failover group cupsgroup, failover complete. node001 became active

[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups[cupsgroup]]%


**Setting Up A Server For The Failover Group**
The CUPS server needs to be configured to run as a service on all the failover group nodes. The usual
way to configure the service is to set it to run only if the node is active, and to be in a stopped state if the
node is passive:


**Example**


[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups[cupsgroup]]% device

[basecm11->device]% foreach -n node001..node002 (services; add cups; _\_
set runif active; set autostart yes; set monitored yes)

[basecm11->device]% commit

Successfully committed 2 Devices

[basecm11->device]%

Mon Apr 7 08:45:54 2014 [notice] node001: Service cups was started


The runif options are described in section 3.14.1.


**Setting And Viewing Parameters And Status In The Failover Group**
**Knowing which node is active:** The status command shows a summary of the various failover groups
in the failovergroups submode, including which node in each group is currently the active one:


**Example**


[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups]% status

Name State Active Nodes

------------ ------------ ------------ -------------------------
cupsgroup ok node001 node001,node002 [ UP ]


**15.5 HA For Regular Nodes And Edge Director Nodes** **769**


**Making a node active:** To set a particular node to be active, the makeactive command can be used
from within the failover group:


**Example**


[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups]% use cupsgroup

[basecm11->...]->failovergroups[cupsgroup]]% makeactive node002

node002 becoming active ...

[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups[cupsgroup]]%

... Failover group cupsgroup, make node002 become active

...node001: Service cups was stopped

...node002: Service cups was started

...Failover group cupsgroup, failover complete. node002 became active


An alternative is to simply use the cmha utility (section 15.4.2):


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmha makeactive node002


**Parameters for failover groups:** Some useful regular node HA parameters for the failover group object, cupsgroup in this case, can be seen with the show command:


**Example**


[basecm11->partition[base]->failovergroups]% show cupsgroup

Parameter Value

-------------------------------------------- --------------------

Disable automatic failover no

Mount script

Unmount script

Warn time 5


**Setting Up The Virtual Interface To Make The Server An HA Service**
The administrator then assigns each node in the failover group the same alias interface name and IP
address dotted quad on its physical interface. The alias interface for each node should be assigned to
start up if the node becomes active.


**Example**


[basecm11->device]% foreach -n node001..node002 (interfaces; add alias _\_
bootif:0 ; set ip 10.141.240.1; set startif active; set network internalnet)

[basecm11->device*]% commit

Successfully committed 2 Devices

[basecm11->device]% foreach -n node001..node002 (interfaces; list)

Type Network device name IP Network

------------ -------------------- ---------------- ---------------
alias BOOTIF:0 10.141.240.1 internalnet

physical BOOTIF [prov] 10.141.0.1 internalnet

Type Network device name IP Network


**770** **High Availability**


------------ -------------------- ---------------- ---------------
alias BOOTIF:0 10.141.240.1 internalnet

physical BOOTIF [prov] 10.141.0.2 internalnet


Optionally, each alias node interface can conveniently be assigned a common arbitrary additional
host name, perhaps associated with the server, which is CUPS. This does not result in duplicate names
here because only one alias interface is active at a time. Setting different additional hostnames for the
alias interface to be associated with a unique virtual IP address is not recommended.


**Example**


[basecm11->...interfaces*[BOOTIF:0*]]% set additionalhostnames cups

[basecm11->...interfaces*[BOOTIF:0*]]% commit


The preceding can also simply be included as part of the set commands in the foreach statement
earlier when the interface was created.

The nodes in the failover group should then be rebooted.
Only the virtual IP address should be used to access the service when using it as a service. Other
IP addresses may be used to access the nodes that are in the failover group for other purposes, such as
monitoring or direct access.


**Service Configuration Adjustments**
A service typically needs to have some modifications in its configuration done to serve the needs of the
cluster.

CUPS uses port 631 for its service and by default it is only accessible to the local host. Its default
configuration is modified by changing some directives within the cupsd.conf file. For example, some
of the lines in the default file may be:
