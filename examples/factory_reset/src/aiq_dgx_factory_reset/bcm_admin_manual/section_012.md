### **Post-installation Software** **Management**

**Introduction: What Is Post-installation Software Management?**
After NVIDIA Base Command Manager has been installed, administrators are expected to manage and
update the distribution software and the cluster software as updates are packaged and made available
by the distribution and by the BCM software development team. Managing and updating means carrying out software management actions such as installation, removal, updating, version checking, and so

on.


**Security And Hardening**
For security vulnerabilities in BCM packages, BCM support can be contacted directly (section 14.2).
Vulnerabilities that are part of the underlying distribution are dealt with by the distribution itself.
By default, BCM aims to keep the distribution unchanged from its original release.


**Security updates:** Security updates are normally handled by package managers.


  - Security updates that the distributions provide as package updates are handled by updating the
distribution that underlies BCM.


  - Security updates that BCM provides as package updates are handled by updating the BCM packages as usual.


In both cases the package managers (one of yum, zypper, or apt ) are used to update the distribution
(one of RHEL/Rocky, SUSE, or Ubuntu) that underlies BCM, or to update the BCM packages.
Security changes outside of BCM package management are normally outside the scope of BCM support.


**Hardening:** Hardening the distribution can include the following actions:


  - removing packages


  - blocking off ports


  - disabling input hardware (USB ports, keyboards, mice...) in software


  - adding disk encryption


  - configuring SELinux


  - adding binaries hardened in some way


**496** **Post-installation Software Management**


Hardening is often possible but is not performed by default because BCM aims to keep the distribution
as close to standard as possible.
Hardening can have unexpected side effects, including impacts on performance. Since hardening
always involves balancing performance, usability, and security, it is the cluster administrator’s responsibility to decide what to harden. Any hardening measures outside of BCM software typically fall outside
the scope of BCM support.


**An Aside About Upgrading The OS Or BCM**
Upgrading from an earlier major release of the OS upon which BCM runs, to the next major release of
the OS (for example, RHEL8 to RHEL9) while keeping BCM as it is, is not supported due to the OS
dependencies that BCM has. If the OS is to be upgraded, then the recommendation is to install BCM
once again from scratch on the upgraded OS.
Upgrading packages is only possible within the existing major OS release or existing BCM release.
Upgrading and updating are often ambiguously used as synonyms:


  - When the OS upgrades to the next major release—for example, when the operating system is upgraded from RHEL8 to RHEL9—and the package is updated as part of that release, then updating
the package is called a _package upgrade_ or a _release upgrade_ .


  - Within an operating system major release—for example, when the operating system is still at a
particular major version such as RHEL8 or RHEL9—updating a package is called a _package update_,
or somewhat confusingly, also called a _package upgrade_, with the latter term being used in the
context of it being the complement of a release upgrade.


Release upgrade packages are typically incompatible with packages from other releases, as many
system administrators typically discover early on in their careers when they try to put a package update into a release upgrade, or the other way round. Even minor version package differences can be
incompatible, as shown by the documentation and policies explaining compatibility levels ( [https://](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel8-abi-compatibility)
[access.redhat.com/articles/rhel8-abi-compatibility](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel8-abi-compatibility), [https://access.redhat.com/articles/](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel9-abi-compatibility)
[rhel9-abi-compatibility](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel9-abi-compatibility) ). Letting the package manager sort it all out is what the sensible cluster
administrator does.


**Post-installation Software Management Typically Uses The Default Package Managers**
Since BCM is built on top of an existing Linux distribution, the administrator should use the package
utilities that are specific for the distribution (such as YUM and rpm, APT and dpkg, or YaST and Zypper)
for software package management.
Packages managed by the distribution are hosted by distribution repositories. SUSE and RHEL distributions require the purchase of their license in order to access their repositories. The other distributions do not.

DGX OS, which is Ubuntu-based, relies on Ubuntu repositories. While BCM manuals cover much of
DGX OS management, package and release upgrades for DGX OS are covered in the dedicated DGX OS
documentation at


 - [https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-os-7-user-guide/upgrading-the-os.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-os-7-user-guide/upgrading-the-os.html) which covers upgrading an existing DGX OS 7.


 - [https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-os-7-user-guide/additional_software.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-os-7-user-guide/additional_software.html) which covers upgrading other software on DGX OS 7.


Packages managed by BCM are hosted by the BCM repository. Access to the BCM repositories also
requires a license (Chapter 4 of the _Installation Manual_ ). Available packages for a particular BCM version
and distribution can be viewed via the _package dashboard_ at [https://support.brightcomputing.com/](https://support.brightcomputing.com/packages-dashboard/)
[packages-dashboard/](https://support.brightcomputing.com/packages-dashboard/) .


**9.1 NVIDIA Base Command Manager Packages, Their Naming Convention And Version** **497**


**Software Outside Of Default Package Management**
There may also be software that the administrator would like to install that is outside the default packages collection. These could be source files that need compilation, or packages in other repositories.


**Software Image Management**
A software image (section 2.1.2) is a filesystem that a node picks up from a provisioner (a head node or
a provisioning node) during provisioning so that the node can run as a linux system after provisioning.
A subtopic of software management on a cluster is software image management—the management of
software on a software image. By default, a node uses the same distribution as the head node for its base
image along with necessary minimal, cluster-mandated changes. A node may however deviate from the
default, and be customized by having software added to it in several ways.


**Techniques Of Software Management Covered**
This chapter covers the techniques of software management for the cluster.
Section 9.1 describes the naming convention for a BCM RPM or .deb package.
Section 9.2 describes how an RPM or .deb package is managed for the head node.
Section 9.3 describes how an RPM or .deb kernel package can be managed on a head node or image.
Section 9.4 describes how an RPM or .deb package can be managed on a software image.
Section 9.5 describes how a software other than an RPM or .deb package can be managed on a software image.
Section 9.6 describes how custom software images are created that are completely independent of
the existing software image distribution and version.
Section 9.7 describes how multi-architecture and multi-distribution images can be created.


**9.1** **NVIDIA Base Command Manager Packages, Their Naming Convention**
**And Version**


Like the distributions it runs on top of, BCM uses


  - either .rpm packages, managed by RPM (RPM Package Manager) or Zypper (ZYpp package manager)


  - or .deb (Debian) packages, managed by APT (Advanced Package Tool)


For example, the cmdaemon package built by BCM has the following .rpm and .deb packages:


cmdaemon-HEAD-152061_cmHEAD_ec0ea0f4d1.x86_64.rpm # for Rocky8 and SUSE

cmdaemon_HEAD-152061-cmHEAD-ec0ea0f4d1_amd64.deb # for Ubuntu BCM9.2


The file name has the following structure:


_package_  - _version_  - _revision_ _cm _x_ . _y_ _ _hash_ . _architecture_ .rpm


and


_package_ _ _version_  - _revision_ -cm _x_ . _y_  - _hash_ _ _architecture_ .deb


where:


 - _package_ ( cmdaemon ) is the name of the package


 - _version_ ( HEAD ) is the version number of the package


 - _revision_ ( 152061 ) is the revision number of the package


 - cm is used to indicate it is a package built by BCM for the cluster manager


**498** **Post-installation Software Management**


 - _x_ . _y_ ( HEAD ) is the version of BCM for which the RPM was built


 - _hash_ ( ec0ea0f4d1 ) is a hash, and is only present for BCM packages. It is used for reference by the
developers of BCM.


 - _architecture_ ( x86_64 for RPMs or amd64 for APT) is the architecture for which the package was
built. The architecture name of x86_64 or amd64 refers the same 64-bit x86 physical hardware in
either case.


The differences in .rpm versus .deb package names are just some underbar/hyphen (_/-) changes,
the hash (only for BCM packages), and the architecture naming convention.
Among the distributions supported by BCM, only Ubuntu uses .deb packages. The rest of the distributions use .rpm packages.


**Querying The Packages**
To check whether BCM or the distribution has provided a file that is already installed on the system, the
package it has come from can be found.


**For RPM-based systems:** rpm -qf can be used with the full path of the file:


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# rpm -qf /usr/bin/zless

gzip-1.9-9.el8.x86_64

[root@basecm11 ~]# rpm -qf /cm/local/apps/cmd/sbin/cmd

cmdaemon-HEAD-146965_cmHEAD_e6f593b676.x86_64


In the example, /usr/bin/zless is supplied by the distribution, while /cm/local/apps/cmd/sbin/
cmd is supplied by BCM, as indicated by the “ _cm ” in the nomenclature.


**For APT-based systems:** A similar check can be done using dpkg -S to find the .deb package that
provided the file, and then dpkg -s on the package name to reveal further information:


**Example**


[root@basecm11:~# dpkg -S /cm/local/apps/cmd/etc/cmd.env
cmdaemon: /cm/local/apps/cmd/etc/cmd.env

[root@basecm11:~# dpkg -s cmdaemon

Package: cmdaemon

Status: install ok installed

Priority: optional

Section: devel

Installed-Size: 78631

Maintainer: Cluster Manager Development <dev@brightcomputing.com>

Architecture: amd64

Version: HEAD-152061-cmHEAD-ec0ea0f4d1

Provides: cmdaemon

...


As an aside, system administrators should be aware that the BCM version of a package is provided
and used instead of a distribution-provided version for various technical reasons. The most important
one is that it is tested and supported by BCM. Replacing the BCM version with a distribution-provided
version can result in subtle and hard-to-trace problems in the cluster, and support cannot be provided
for a cluster that is in such a state, although some guidance may be given in special cases.
More information about the RPM Package Manager is available at [http://www.rpm.org](http://www.rpm.org), while APT
is documented for Ubuntu at [http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/) .


**9.1 NVIDIA Base Command Manager Packages, Their Naming Convention And Version** **499**


**9.1.1** **The** packages **Command**
BCM also provides the packages command in the device mode of cmsh . This should not be confused with the packages command used by zypper . The packages command used by cmsh displays
an overview of the installed packages, independent of rpm or deb package management.
The -a|--all option can be used to list all the packages installed on a particular node:


**Example**


[basecm11]% device use node001

[basecm11->device[node001]]% packages -a

Node Type Name Version Arch Size Install date

-------- ------- ----------------- ------------------ -------- ------- -------------------
node001 deb accountsservice 0.6.45-1ubuntu1 amd64 440kB 2019/02/14 10:51:06

node001 deb acl 2.2.52-3build1 amd64 200kB 2019/02/14 10:51:19

node001 deb acpid 1:2.0.28-1ubuntu1 amd64 139kB 2019/02/14 10:51:19

node001 deb adduser 3.116ubuntu1 all 624kB 2019/02/14 10:49:53

...


The -c|--category option can be used to list all the packages installed in a node category:


**Example**


[basecm11]% device

[basecm11->device]% packages -a -c default

Node Type Name Version Arch Size Install date

-------- ------ ------------------ --------------------------- ------- -------------------
node001 deb accountsservice 0.6.45-1ubuntu1 amd64 440kB 2019/02/14 10:51:06

node001 deb acl 2.2.52-3build1 amd64 200kB 2019/02/14 10:51:19

...

node002 deb accountsservice 0.6.45-1ubuntu1 amd64 440kB 2019/02/14 10:51:06

node002 deb acl 2.2.52-3build1 amd64 200kB 2019/02/14 10:51:19

...


Running the -a option for many nodes can be user-unfriendly. That is because per node this command typically returns about 100KB of data. So, for a 1000 nodes this would output about 100MB and a
table with nearly a million lines.
When checking packages for many nodes, it is best to request the package by name. Multiple
-f|--find options can be used in the command line to display several packages.


**Example**


[basecm11]% device

[basecm11->device]% packages -c default -f cmdaemon

Node Type Name Version Release Arch Size ... Install date

-------- ----- -------- -------- ------------------------- ------- ------ --- ------------------
node001 rpm cmdaemon 10.0 157349_cm10.0_5f6db110aa x86_64 85MiB 2024/03/28 07:28:36

...


Further options, and examples, can be listed by running the help packages command within the
device mode of cmsh .


**9.1.2** **BCM Package Point Release Versions And The** cm-package-release-info **Command**
The cm-package-release-info command displays a precise package release version (package version)
for each BCM package used in the cluster, and shows the BCM point release versions that should use
that package version.


**500** **Post-installation Software Management**


**Background Information On BCM Version Nomenclature**
The _cluster manager version_ is a _release number_ with one decimal point— 10.0 in the preceding example.
This is recorded in the file /etc/cm-release, and can also be seen in the output of the versioninfo
command:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh -c "main; versioninfo"

Version Information

------------------- -----
Cluster Manager 10.0

...


The release number is the main way to refer to the software release version. It is a tag that is associated with the whole collection of packages that is released as BCM. Using the release number for this
avoids confusion with the _point release number_ . A point release number based on 10.0 is a numbering
sequence with two decimal points, and might look like:


10.23.09


Point releases are interim releases, based on the main release version, but with fixes and updates.
A point release based on 10.0 takes the format:


10.<YY>.<MM>


For example, for 10.23.09 of earlier, the .0 from 10.0 is dropped for convenience, the year 2023 is
indicated by 23, and the month of September is indicated by 09 . Release numbers prior to 10.0 had other
point release formats.
One more addition to the point release number is a letter suffix, in lower case, alphabetical order.
This is typically for a “hotfix” release, where an existing point release is deemed to need an important
fix right away, instead of having the fix wait until it goes into the next point release. For example, if the
10.23.09 point release needs a new fix a day after its initial release, then the release is given the label:


10.23.09a


**Using a package manager means knowing about point releases is typically unnecessary:** Point releases and other fixes for the release number may have dependencies. The package manager typically
resolves these issues by keeping BCM packages correctly updated within the major release number,
so that typically a cluster administrator does not need to track the exact point release. Referring to
a point release during regular cluster administration is therefore typically avoided. Indeed, referring
to a specific point release is often inappropriate, as discussed in [https://kb.brightcomputing.com/](https://kb.brightcomputing.com/knowledge-base/how-to-tell-what-bcm-version-are-you-running/)
[knowledge-base/how-to-tell-what-bcm-version-are-you-running/](https://kb.brightcomputing.com/knowledge-base/how-to-tell-what-bcm-version-are-you-running/), where it is pointed out that
different packages may be updated to different point releases.


**Using The** cm-package-release-info **Command To Get A BCM Package Point Release Version**
Yet, on some occasions it may be necessary to know the exact point release versions available for BCM
packages. For example, in order to override dependencies if customizing a cluster in a non-standard
way. Usually the point release information is needed for the main package, cmdaemon . Running the
cm-package-release-info command displays the version of a BCM package, and for which point releases it is available for the current release number of the cluster.


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cm-package-release-info

Name Version Release(s)

--------------------- -------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Lmod 100094 10.24.03, 10.24.01, 10.23.09a, 10.23.10, 10.23.11, 10.23.12, 10.23.09

atftp-server 619 10.24.03

base-view 106987 10.24.03


**9.2 Managing Packages On The Head Node** **501**


blacs-openmpi-gcc-64 116 10.24.03, 10.24.01, 10.23.09a, 10.23.10, 10.23.11, 10.23.12, 10.23.09

blas-gcc-64 87 10.24.03, 10.24.01, 10.23.09a, 10.23.10, 10.23.11, 10.23.12, 10.23.09

...


A package can be specified with the -f option:


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cm-package-release-info -f cmdaemon,cluster-tools

Name Version Release(s)

------------- -------- ---------
cluster-tools 119838 10.23.11

cmdaemon 156713 10.23.10


**9.2** **Managing Packages On The Head Node**


**9.2.1** **Managing RPM Or .deb Packages On The Head Node**
Once BCM has been installed, distribution packages and BCM software packages are conveniently managed using the yum, zypper or apt repository and package managers. The zypper tool is recommended
for use with the SUSE distribution, the apt utility is recommended for use with Ubuntu, and yum is
recommended for use with the other distributions that BCM supports. YUM is not set up by default
in SUSE, and it is better not to install and use it with SUSE unless the administrator is familiar with
configuring YUM.


**Listing Packages On The Head Node With YUM and Zypper**
For YUM and zypper, the following commands list all available packages:


yum list

or

zypper refresh; zypper packages


For zypper, the short command option pa can also be used instead of packages .


**Listing Packages On The Head Node With APT**
For Ubuntu, the apt-cache command is used to view available packages. To generate the cache used by
the command, the command:


apt-cache gencaches


can be run.

A verbose list of available packages can then be seen by running:


apt-cache dumpavail


It is usually more useful to use the search option to apt-cache to search for the package with a regex:


apt-cache search < _regex_ 

A similar, but slightly more verbose option is the search option for apt :
apt search < _regex_ 

**502** **Post-installation Software Management**


**Updating/Installing Packages On The Head Node**
To install a new package called _<package name>_ into a distribution, the corresponding package managers
are used as follows:


yum install < _package name_ zypper in < _package name_ - #for SLES
apt install < _package name_ - #for Ubuntu


Installed packages can be updated to the latest by the corresponding package manager as follows:


yum update

zypper refresh; zypper up #refresh recommended to update package metadata

apt update; apt upgrade #update recommended to update package metadata


**An aside on the differences between the** update **,** refresh/up **, and** update/upgrade **options of the**
**package managers:** The update option in YUM by default installs any new packages. On the other
hand, the refresh option in zypper, and the update option in APT only update the meta-data (the
repository indices). Only if the meta-data is up-to-date will an update via zypper, or an upgrade via apt
install any newly-known packages. For convenience, in the BCM manuals, the term update is used in
the YUM sense in general—that is, to mean including the installation of new packages—unless otherwise stated.


The BCM repository has YUM and zypper repositories of its packages at:


http://updates.brightcomputing.com/yum


and updates are fetched by YUM and zypper for BCM packages from there by default, to overwrite
older package versions by default.
For Ubuntu, the BCM .deb package repositories are at:


http://updates.brightcomputing.com/deb


Accessing the repositories manually (i.e. not using yum, zypper, or apt ) requires a username and
password. Authentication credentials can be provided upon request by opening a support ticket (section 14.2).


**Cleaning Package Caches On The Head Node**
The repository managers use caches to speed up their operations. Occasionally these caches may need
flushing to clean up the index files associated with the repository. This can be done by the appropriate
package manager with:


yum clean all

zypper clean -a #for SUSE

apt-get clean #for Ubuntu


**Signed Package Verification**
As an extra protection to prevent BCM installations from receiving malicious updates, all BCM packages
are signed with the Bright Computing GPG public key ( 0x5D849C16 ), installed by default in /etc/pki/
rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-cm for Red Hat and derivaties. The Bright Computing public key is also listed
in Appendix B.
The first time YUM or zypper are used to install updates, the user is asked whether the Bright Computing public key should be imported into the local repository packages database. Before answering
with a “ Y ”, yum users may choose to compare the contents of /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-cm with
the key listed in Appendix B to verify its integrity. Alternatively, the key may be imported into the local
RPM database directly, using the following command:


rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-cm


**9.3 Kernel Management On A Head Node Or Image** **503**


With APT, the BCM keyring is already imported into /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
brightcomputing-archive-cm.gpg if the cm-config-apt package, provided by the Bright Computing repository, has been installed. The cm-config-apt package is installed by default for the Ubuntu
edition of BCM.


**Third Party Packages**
The third party packages in the following list may be repackaged for BCM for installation purposes. The
packages are described in Chapter 7 of the _Installation Manual_ :


  - Modules (section 7.1)


  - Shorewall (section 7.2)


  - GCC (section 7.3)


Exclusion of packages on the head node can be carried out as explained in section 9.3.2, where the
kernel package is used as an example for exclusion.


**9.2.2** **Installation Of Packages On The Head Node That Are Not .deb And Not .rpm Packages**
Sometimes a package is not packaged as an RPM or .deb package for BCM or for the distribution. In
that case, the software can usually be treated as for installation onto a standard distribution. There may
be special considerations on placement of components that the administrator may feel appropriate due
to the particulars of a cluster configuration.
For example, for compilation and installation of the software, some consideration may be made
of the options available on where to install parts of the software within the default shared filesystem. A software may have a compile option, say --prefix, that places an application _<application>_
in a directory specified by the administrator. If the administrator decides that _<application>_ should be
placed in the shared directory, so that everyone can access it, the option could then be specified as:
“ --prefix=/cm/shared/apps/ < _application>_ ”.
Other commonly provided components of software for the applications that are placed in shared may
be documentation, licenses, configuration settings, and examples. These may be placed in the directories
/cm/shared/docs, /cm/shared/licenses, /cm/shared/etc, and /cm/shared/examples . The placement
may be done with a compiler option, or, if that is not done or not possible, it could be done by modifying
the placement by hand later. It is not obligatory to do the change of placement, but it helps with cluster
administration to stay consistent as packages are added.
Module files (section 2.2 of this manual, and 7.1 of the _Installation Manual_ ) may sometimes be provided by the software, or created by the administrator to make the application work for users easily
with the right components. The directory /cm/shared/modulefiles is recommended for module files
to do with such software.

To summarize the above considerations on where to place software components, the directories under /cm/shared that can be used for these components are:


/cm/shared/

|-- apps

|-- docs

|-- etc

|-- examples

|-- licenses

`-- modulefiles


**9.3** **Kernel Management On A Head Node Or Image**


Care should be taken when updating a head node or a software image. This is particularly true when
custom kernel modules compiled against a particular kernel version are being used.


**504** **Post-installation Software Management**


A package can be managed in a software image and the image deployed to nodes. A careful administrator typically clones a copy of a working image that is known to work, before modifying the
image.


**9.3.1** **Installing A Standard Distribution Kernel Into An Image Or On A Head Node**
A standard distribution kernel is treated almost like any other package in a distribution.
This means that:


  - For head nodes, installing a standard kernel is done according to the normal procedures of managing a package on a head node (section 9.2).


  - For regular nodes, installing a standard distribution kernel is done according to the normal procedures of managing an package inside an image, via a changed root (chroot) directory (section 9.4),
but with some special aspects that are discussed in this section.


When a kernel is updated or reinstalled (section 9.3.3), kernel-specific drivers, such as OFED drivers
may need to be updated or reinstalled. OFED driver installation details are given in Chapter 10 of the
_Installation Manual_ .


**Kernel Package Name Formats**
For RHEL, individual kernel package names take a form such as:
kernel-3.10.0-327.3.1.el7.x86_64.rpm
The actual one suited to a cluster varies according to the distribution used. RPM Packages with names
that begin with “ kernel-devel- ” are development packages that can be used to compile custom kernels,
and are not required when installing standard distribution kernels.
For Ubuntu, individual Linux kernel image package names take a form such as:
linux-image-*.deb

or

linux-signed-image-*.deb


Running apt-cache search [�] linux | grep 'kernel image' shows the various packaged kernel
images in the distribution.


**Other Extra Considerations**

When installing a kernel, besides the chroot steps of section 9.4, extra considerations for kernel packages

are:


  - The kernel must also be explicitly set in CMDaemon (section 9.3.3) before it may be used by the
regular nodes.


  - If using the chroot method to install the kernel rather than the cm-chroot-sw-img method (section 9.4.1), some other warnings to do with missing /proc paths may appear. For RHEL and
derivatives, these warnings can be ignored.


  - The ramdisk of a regular node must be regenerated using the createramdisk command (section 9.4.3).


  - If the cluster is in a high availability configuration, then installing a new kernel on to the active
head node may in some edge cases stop its network interface, and trigger a failover. It is therefore
usually wiser to make the change on the passive head node first, or to disable automatic failover,
before carrying out a change that could initiate a failover.


As is standard for Linux, both head or regular nodes must be rebooted to use the new kernel.


**9.3 Kernel Management On A Head Node Or Image** **505**


**9.3.2** **Excluding Kernels And Other Packages From Updates**

**Specifying A Kernel Or Other Package For Update Exclusion**
Sometimes it may be desirable to exclude the kernel from updates on the head node.


  - When using yum, to prevent an automatic update of a package, the package is listed after using
the --exclude flag. So, to exclude the kernel from the list of packages that should be updated, the
following command can be used:


yum --exclude kernel update


To exclude a package such as kernel permanently from all YUM updates, without having to specify it on the command line each time, the package can instead be excluded inside the repository
configuration file. YUM repository configuration files are located in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory, and the packages to be excluded are specified with a space-separated format like this:


exclude = <package 1> <package 2> ...


  - The zypper command can also carry out the task of excluding the kernel package from getting
updated when updating. To do this, the kernel package is first locked (prevented from change)
using the addlock command, and the update command is run. Optionally, the kernel package is
unlocked again using the removelock command:


zypper addlock kernel

zypper update

zypper removelock kernel #optional


  - One APT way to upgrade the software while excluding the kernel image package is to first update
the system, then to mark the kernel as a package that is to be held, and then to upgrade the system.
Optionally, after the upgrade, the hold mark can be removed:


apt update
apt-mark hold < _linux-image-version_   
apt upgrade
apt-mark unhold < _linux-image-version_   - #optional


The complementary way to carry out an upgrade in APT while holding the kernel back, is to use
_pinning_ . Pinning can be used to set dependency priorities during upgrades. Once set, it can hold a
particular package back while the rest of the system upgrades.


**Specifying A Repository For Update Exclusion**
Sometimes it is useful to exclude an entire repository from an update on the head node. For example,
the administrator may wish to exclude updates to the parent distribution, and only want updates for the
cluster manager to be pulled in. In that case, in RHEL-derivatives a construction such as the following
may be used to specify that only the repository IDs matching the glob cm* are used, from the repositories
in /etc/yum.repos.d/ :


[root@basecm11 ~]# yum repolist

...

122 packages excluded due to repository priority protections

repo id repo name status
base/7/x86_64 CentOS-7 - Base 10,067+30

cm-rhel7-HEAD/x86_64 CM HEAD for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 10,949+56
epel/x86_64 Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - x86_64 13,324+92

extras/7/x86_64 CentOS-7 - Extras 301+3

updates/7/x86_64 CentOS-7 - Updates 332

repolist: 34,973

[root@basecm11 ~]# yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=cm* update


**506** **Post-installation Software Management**


In Ubuntu, repositories can be added or removed by editing the repository sources under /etc/
apt/sources.list.d/ . There is also the apt edit-sources command, which, unsurprisingly, also edits the repository sources. The add-apt-repository command ( man add-apt-repository.1 ) edits the
repository sources by line. Running add-apt-repository -h shows options and examples.


**9.3.3** **Updating A Kernel In A Software Image**
A kernel is typically updated in the software image by carrying out a package installation using the
chroot environment (section 9.4), or specifying a relative root directory setting.
Package dependencies can sometimes prevent the package manager from carrying out the update,
for example in the case of OFED packages (Chapter 10 of the _Installation Manual_ ). In such cases, the
administrator can specify how the dependency should be resolved.
Parent distributions are by default configured, by the distribution itself, so that only up to 3 kernel
images are kept when installing a new kernel with the package manager. However, in a BCM cluster,
this default distribution value is overridden by a default BCM value, so that kernel images are never
removed during YUM updates, or apt upgrade, by default.
For a software image, if the kernel is updated by the package manager, then the kernel is not used
on reboot until it is explicitly enabled with either Base View or cmsh .


  - To enable it using Base View, the Kernel version entry for the software image should be set. This
can be accessed via the navigation path Provisioning    - Software images    - Edit    - Settings    Kernel version (figure 9.1).


Figure 9.1: Updating A Software Image Kernel With Base View


  - To enable the updated kernel from cmsh, the softwareimage mode is used. The kernelversion
property of a specified software image is then set and committed:


**9.3 Kernel Management On A Head Node Or Image** **507**


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% softwareimage

[basecm11]->softwareimage% use default-image

[basecm11->softwareimage[default-image]]% set kernelversion 3.10.0-327.3.1.el7.x86_64

[basecm11->softwareimage*[default-image*]]% commit -w


Tab-completion suggestions for the set kernelversion command will display the available values
for the kernel version.


**9.3.4** **Setting Kernel Options For Software Images**
A standard kernel can be booted with special options that alter its functionality. For example, a kernel can boot with apm=off, to disable Advanced Power Management, which is sometimes useful as a
workaround for nodes with a buggy BIOS that may crash occasionally when it remains enabled.
In Base View, to enable booting with this kernel option setting, the navigation path Provisioning  Software images - Edit - Settings - Kernel parameters (figure 9.1) is used to set the kernel parameter to apm=off for that particular image.
In cmsh, the equivalent method is to modify the value of “ kernel parameters ” in softwareimage
mode for the selected image:


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% softwareimage

[basecm11]->softwareimage% use default-image

[basecm11->softwareimage[default-image]]% append kernelparameters " apm=off"

[basecm11->softwareimage*[default-image*]]% commit


Often kernel options load up modules and their parameters. Making module loading persist after
reboot and setting module loading order is covered in section 5.3.2
Some kernel options may require changes to be made in the BIOS settings in order to function.


**9.3.5** **Kernel Driver Modules**

BCM provides some packages which install new kernel drivers or update kernel drivers. In RPMbased distributions, such packages generally require the kernel-devel package. In this section, the
kernel-devel-check utility is first described, followed by the various drivers that BCM provides.


**Kernel Driver Modules:** kernel-devel-check **Compilation Check**
For RPM, the distribution’s kernel-devel package is required to compile kernel drivers for its kernel.
It must be the same version and release as the kernel running on the node. For APT, the linux-header
package corresponding to the kernel image is used.
In RPM-based distributions, to check the head node and software images for the installation status
of the kernel-devel package, the BCM utility kernel-devel-check is run from the head node:


**Example**


[root@mycluster ~]# kernel-devel-check

Head node: mycluster

No kernel development directories found, probably no kernel development package installed.

package kernel-devel-3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64 is not installed

Kernel development package kernel-devel-3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64 not found

If needed, try to install the kernel development package with:

# yum install kernel-devel-3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64


**508** **Post-installation Software Management**


Software image: default-image

No kernel development directories found, probably no kernel development package installed.

package kernel-devel-3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64 is not installed

Kernel development package kernel-devel-3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64 not found

If needed, try to install the kernel development package with:
# chroot /cm/images/default-image yum install kernel-devel-3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64


As suggested by the output of kernel-devel-check, running a command on the head node such as:


[root@mycluster ~]# chroot /cm/images/default-image1 yum install \

kernel-devel-3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64


installs a kernel-devel package, to the software image called default-image1 in this case. The package
version suggested corresponds to the kernel version set for the image, rather than necessarily the latest
one that the distribution provides.


**Kernel Driver Modules: Improved Intel Wired Ethernet Drivers**
**Improved Intel wired Ethernet drivers—what they are:** The standard RHEL and SLES distributions
provide Intel wired Ethernet driver modules as part of the kernel they provide. BCM provides an improved version of the drivers with its own intel-wired-ethernet-drivers package. The package contains more recent versions of the Intel wired Ethernet kernel drivers: e1000, e1000e, igb, igbvf, ixgbe
and ixgbevf . They often work better than standard distribution modules when it comes to performance,
features, or stability.


**Improved Intel wired Ethernet drivers—replacement mechanism:** The improved drivers can be installed on all nodes.

For head nodes, the standard Intel wired Ethernet driver modules on the hard drive are overwritten
by the improved versions during package installation. Backing up the standard driver modules before
installation is recommended, because it may be that some particular hardware configurations are unable
to cope with the changes, in which case reverting to the standard drivers may be needed.
For regular nodes, the standard distribution wired Ethernet drivers are not overwritten into the
provisioner’s software image during installation of the improved drivers package. Instead, the standard
driver modules are removed from the kernel and the improved modules are loaded to the kernel during
the init stage of boot.
For regular nodes in this “unwritten” state, removing the improved drivers package from the software image restores the state of the regular node, so that subsequent boots end up with a kernel running
the standard distribution drivers from on the image once again. This is useful because it allows a very
close-to-standard distribution to be maintained on the nodes, thus allowing better distribution support
to be provided for the nodes.
If the software running on a fully-booted regular node is copied over to the software image, for example using the “ Grab to image ” button (section 9.5.2), this will write the improved driver module into
the software image. Restoring to the standard version is then no longer possible with simply removing
the improved drivers packages. This makes the image less close-to-standard, and distribution support
is then less easily obtained for the node.
Thus, after the installation of the package is done on a head or regular node, for every boot from the
next boot onward, the standard distribution Intel wired Ethernet drivers are replaced by the improved
versions for fully-booted kernels. This replacement occurs before the network and network services
start. The head node simply boots from its drive with the new drivers, while a regular node initially
starts with the kernel using the driver on the software image, but then if the driver differs from the
improved one, the driver is unloaded and the improved one is compiled and loaded.


**9.4 Managing A Package In A Software Image And Running It On Nodes** **509**


**Improved Intel wired Ethernet drivers—installation:** The drivers are compiled on the fly on the regular nodes, so a check should first be done that the kernel-devel package is installed on the regular
nodes (section 9.3.5).
If the regular nodes have the kernel-devel package installed, then the following yum commands are
issued on the head node, to install the package on the head node and in the default-image :


**Example**


[root@mycluster ~]# yum install intel-wired-ethernet-drivers

[root@mycluster ~]# chroot /cm/images/default-image

[root@mycluster /]# yum install intel-wired-ethernet-drivers


For SUSE, the equivalent zypper commands are used (“ zypper in ” instead of “ yum install ”).


**Kernel Driver Modules: CUDA Driver Installation**

CUDA drivers are drivers the kernel uses to manage GPUs. These are compiled on the fly for nodes
with GPUs in BCM. The details of how this is done is covered in the CUDA software section (Chapter 9
of the _Installation Manual_ ).


**Kernel Driver Modules: OFED Stack Installation**

By default, the distribution provides the OFED stack used by the kernel to manage the InfiniBand or
RDMA interconnect. Installing an NVIDIA DOCA OFED stack to replace the distribution version is
covered in Chapter 10 of the _Installation Manual_ . Some guidance on placement into initrd for the purpose
of optional InfiniBand-based node provisioning is given in section 5.3.3.


**9.4** **Managing A Package In A Software Image And Running It On Nodes**


A package can be managed in a software image and the image deployed to nodes. A careful administrator typically clones a copy of a working image that is known to work, before modifying the image.


**9.4.1** **Installing From Head Into The Image: Changing The Root Directory Into Which The**
**Packages Are Deployed**
Managing packages (including the kernel) inside a software image is most easily done while on the head
node, using a “change root” ( chroot ) mechanism. The easiest way to carry out the chroot mechanism
in BCM is to use a wrapper provided by BCM, cm-chroot-sw-img, which works with all distributions.
The same can be carried out more laboriously using the distribution package managers, such as rpm,
yum, zypper, or apt, by using the associated chroot package manager option, or invoking chroot as a
standalone command.


**Change Root As An Option In The Package Manager Command**
**Using the** rpm **command:** The rpm command supports the --root flag. To install an RPM package
inside the default software image while in the head node environment, using the repositories of the
head node, the command can be used as follows:


**Example**


rpm --root /cm/images/default-image -ivh /tmp/libxml2-2.6.16-6.x86_64.rpm


**Using the** yum **command:** The yum command allows more general updates with a change root option.
For example, all packages in the default image can be updated using yum for RHEL and derivatives with:


**Example**


yum --installroot=/cm/images/default-image update #for RHEL variants


A useful option to restrict the version to which an image is updated, is to use the option
--releasever . For example, to allow only updates up to RHEL9.1, the command in the preceding
example would have --releasever=9.1 appended to it.


**510** **Post-installation Software Management**


**Using the** zypper **command:** For SLES, zypper can be used as follows to update the image:


**Example**


zypper --root /cm/images/default-image up #for SLES


**Change Root With** chroot **, Then Running The Package Manager Commands**
If the repositories used by the software image are the same as the repositories used by the head node,
then the chroot command can be used instead of the --installroot / --root options to get the same
result as the package manager options. That is, the same result is accomplished by first chroot ing
into an image, and subsequently executing the rpm, yum, or zypper commands without --root or
--installroot arguments. Thus:


**For RHEL and derivatives:** For YUM-based update, running yum update is recommended to update
the image, after using the chroot command to reach the root of the image:


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# chroot /cm/images/default-image

[root@basecm11 /]# yum update #for RHEL variants
... _updates happen..._

[root@basecm11 /]# exit #get out of chroot


**For SLES:** For SLES, running zypper up is recommended to update the image, after using the chroot
command to reach the root of the image:


**Example**


basecm11:~# chroot /cm/images/default-image
basecm11.cm.cluster:/ # zypper up #for SLES
... _updates happen..._
basecm11.cm.cluster:/ # exit #get out of chroot


**For Ubuntu:** For Ubuntu and APT, for package installation into the software image, there is often a
need for the /proc, /sys, /dev, and perhaps other directories to be available within the chroot jail.
Additionally, the /proc namespace used should not be that of the head node due to namespace issues
that affect decision-making in some of the pre- and post-installation script bundled with the package.
Pre-configuring all this with bind mounting before going into the chrooted filesystem is a little tedious. Therefore the BCM utility, cm-chroot-sw-img, is strongly recommended to take care of this.
Thus, for Ubuntu, if the cluster administrator would like to run apt update; apt upgrade to update the image, then the recommended way to do it is to start the process with the cm-chroot-sw-img
command:


**Example**


root@basecm11:~# cm-chroot-sw-img /cm/images/default-image
... _messages indicate that the special directories have been mounted automatically, and a chroot jail has been entered..._
root@basecm11:/# apt update; apt upgrade #for Ubuntu
... _An upgrade session runs in the image root. Some administrator inputs may be needed..._
root@basecm11:/# exit #get out of chroot
... _messages indicate that the special directories have been unmounted automatically..._


The cm-chroot-sw-img wrapper is less needed in other distributions, with yum and zypper instead of
apt . This is because the namespace issues are not so serious in with those other distributions. However
even in those other distributions, it is cleaner to use the wrapper.


**9.4 Managing A Package In A Software Image And Running It On Nodes** **511**


**Excluding Packages And Repositories From The Image**
Sometimes it may be desirable to exclude a package or a repository from an image.


  - If using yum --installroot, then to prevent an automatic update of a package, the package is
listed after using the --exclude flag. For example, to exclude the kernel from the list of packages
that should be updated, the following command can be used:


yum --installroot=/cm/images/default-image --exclude kernel update


To exclude a package such as kernel permanently from all YUM updates, without having to specify it on the command line each time, the package can instead be excluded inside the repository
configuration file of the image. YUM repository configuration files are located in the /cm/images/
default-image/etc/yum.repos.d directory, and the packages to be excluded are specified with a
space-separated format like this:


exclude = <package 1> <package 2> ...


  - The zypper command can also carry out the task of excluding a package from getting updated
when during update. To do this, the package is first locked (prevented from change) using the
addlock command, then the update command is run, and finally the package is unlocked again
using the removelock command. For example, for the kernel package:


zypper --root /cm/images/default-image addlock kernel
zypper --root /cm/images/default-image update
zypper --root /cm/images/default-image removelock kernel


  - For Ubuntu, the apt-mark hold command can be used to exclude a package. This is described in
the particular case of excluding the kernel package earlier on, in section 9.3.2.


  - Sometimes it is useful to exclude an entire repository from an update to the image. For example,
the administrator may wish to exclude updates to the base distribution (the distribution packages
used on the node, without the BCM packages), and only want BCM updates to be pulled into the
image. In that case, a construction like the following may be used to specify that, for example, from
the repositories listed in /cm/images/default-image/etc/yum.repos.d/, only the repositories
matching the pattern cm* are used:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cd /cm/images/default-image/etc/yum.repos.d/

[root@basecm11 yum.repos.d]# yum --installroot=/cm/images/defaul _\_

t-image --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=cm* update


  - For Ubuntu, excluding a repository can be carried out by removing the repository under /etc/
apt/sources.list.d/ . Slightly handier may be to use the add-apt-repository command, or the
apt edit-sources command.


**9.4.2** **Installing From Head Into The Image: Updating The Node**
If the images are in place, then the nodes that use those images cannot run those images until they have
the changes placed on the nodes. Rebooting the nodes that use the software images is a straightforward
way to have those nodes start up with the new images. Alternatively, the nodes can usually simply be
updated without a reboot, using imageupdate (section 5.6), if no reboot is required by the underlying
Linux distribution.


**512** **Post-installation Software Management**


**9.4.3** **Installing From Head Into The Image: Possible Issues When Using** rpm --root **,** yum
--installroot **Or** chroot

  - The update process on an image, when using YUM, zypper, or APT, will fail to start if the image is
being provisioned by a provisioner at the time. The administrator can either wait for provisioning
requests to finish, or can ensure no provisioning happens by locking the image (section 5.4.7),
before running the update process. The image can then be updated. The administrator normally
unlocks the image after the update, to allow image maintenance by the provisioners again.


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh -c "softwareimage lock default-image"

[root@basecm11 ~]# yum --installroot /cm/images/default-image update

[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh -c "softwareimage unlock default-image"


  - The rpm --root or yum --installroot command can fail if the versions between the head node
and the version in the software image differ significantly. For example, installation from a RHEL8
head node to a RHEL9 software image is not possible with those commands, and can only be
carried out with chroot .


  - While installing software into a software image with an rpm --root, yum --installroot or with
a chroot method is convenient, there can be issues if daemons start up in the image, or if the
distribution installation scripts exit with errors due to being in an image environment rather than
a real instance.


For example, installation scripts that stop and re-start a system service during a package installation may successfully start that service within the image’s chroot jail and thereby cause related,
unexpected changes in the image. Pre- and post- (un)install scriptlets that are part of RPM or APT
packages may cause similar problems.


BCM’s RPM and .deb packages are designed to install under chroot without issues. However
packages from other repositories may cause the issues described. To deal with that, the cluster
manager runs the chrootprocess health check, which alerts the administrator if there is a daemon
process running in the image. The chrootprocess also checks and kills the process if it is a crond

process.


  - For some package updates, the distribution package management system attempts to modify the
ramdisk image. This is true for kernel updates, many kernel module updates, and some other
packages. Such a modification is designed to work on a normal machine. For a regular node on a
cluster, which uses an extended ramdisk, the attempt does nothing.


In such cases, a new ramdisk image must nonetheless be generated for the regular nodes, or the
nodes will fail during the ramdisk loading stage during start-up (section 5.8.4).


The ramdisk image for the regular nodes can be regenerated manually, using the createramdisk
command (section 5.3.2).


  - Trying to work out what is in the image from under chroot must be done with some care.


For example, under chroot, running “ uname -a ” returns the kernel that is currently running—
that is the kernel outside the chroot. This is typically not the same as the kernel that will load
on the node from the filesystem under chroot. It is the kernel in the filesystem under chroot that
an unwary administrator may wrongly expect to detect on running the uname command under
chroot.


To find the kernel version that is to load from the image, the software image kernel version property (section 9.3.3) can be inspected using the cluster manager with:


**Example**


cmsh -c "softwareimage; use default-image; get kernelversion"


**9.5 Managing Non-RPM Software In A Software Image And Running It On Nodes** **513**


**9.4.4** **Managing A Package In The Node-Installer Image**
A special software image is the node-installer image. The node-installer image was introduced in
NVIDIA Base Command Manager version 9.0, to make multiarch (section 9.7) possible.
The node-installer image is an image that, unsurprisingly, contains the node-installer (section 5.4).
The default /cm/node-installer tree is a standalone image for that architecture. It requires updating
just like the regular software image. So, for example, in YUM, the entire tree can be updated with:


chroot /cm/node-installer yum update


or


yum --installroot=/cm/node-installer update


while a particular package inside the image, such as util-linux, could be installed with:


yum --installroot=/cm/node-installer install util-linux


Updating the node-installer is recommended whenever there are updates available, in order to fix
possible bugs that might affect the node-installer operations.


**9.5** **Managing Non-RPM Software In A Software Image And Running It On**
**Nodes**


Sometimes, packaged software is not available for a software image, but non-packaged software is. This
section describes the installation of non-packaged software onto a software image in these two cases:


1. copying only the software over to the software image (section 9.5.1)


2. placing the software onto the node directly, configuring it until it is working as required, and
syncing that back to the software image using BCM’s special utilities (section 9.5.2)


In both cases, before making changes, a careful administrator typically clones a copy of a working
image that is known to work, before modifying the image.
As a somewhat related aside, completely overhauling the software image, including changing the
base files that distinguish the distribution and version of the image is also possible. How to manage that
kind of extreme change is covered separately in section 9.6.
However, this current section (9.5) is about modifying the software image with non-RPM software
while staying within the framework of an existing distribution and version.
In all cases of installing software to a software image, it is recommended that software components be
placed under appropriate directories under /cm/shared (which is actually outside the software image).
So, just as in the case for installing software to the head node in section 9.2.2, appropriate software
components go under:


/cm/shared/

|-- apps

|-- docs

|-- examples

|-- licenses

`-- modulefiles


**9.5.1** **Managing The Software Directly On An Image**
The administrator may choose to manage the non-packaged software directly in the correct location on
the image.
For example, the administrator may wish to install a particular software to all nodes. If the software
has already been prepared elsewhere and is known to work on the nodes without problems, such as for


**514** **Post-installation Software Management**


example library dependency or path problems, then the required files can simply be copied directly into
the right places on the software image.
The chroot command may also be used to install non-packaged software into a software image. This
is analogous to the chroot technique for installing packages in section 9.4:


**Example**


cd /cm/images/default-image/usr/src
tar -xvzf /tmp/app-4.5.6.tar.gz
chroot /cm/images/default-image
cd /usr/src/app-4.5.6
./configure --prefix=/usr

make install


Whatever method is used to install the software, after it is placed in the software image, the change
can be implemented on all running nodes by running the updateprovisioners (section 5.2.4) and
imageupdate (section 5.6.2) commands.


**9.5.2** **Managing The Software Directly On A Node, Then Syncing Node-To-Image**

**Why Sync Node-To-Image?**
Sometimes, typically if the software to be managed is more complex and needs more care and testing
than might be the case in section 9.5.1, the administrator manages it directly on a node itself, and then
makes an updated image from the node after it is configured, to the provisioner.
For example, the administrator may wish to install and test an application from a node first before
placing it in the image. Many files may be altered during installation in order to make the node work
with the application. Eventually, when the node is in a satisfactory state, and possibly after removing
any temporary installation-related files on the node, a new image can be created, or an existing image
updated.
Administrators should be aware that until the new image is saved, the node loses its alterations and
reverts back to the old image on reboot.
The node-to-image sync can be seen as the converse of the image-to-node sync that is done using
imageupdate (section 5.6.2).
The node-to-image sync discussed in this section is done using the Grab to image menu option
from Base View, or using the “ grabimage ” command with appropriate options in cmsh . The sync automatically excludes network mounts and parallel filesystems such as Lustre and GPFS, but includes any
regular disk mounted on the node itself.
Some words of advice and a warning are in order here


  - The cleanest, and recommended way, to change an image is to change it directly in the node image,
typically via changes within a chroot environment (section 9.5.1).


  - Changing the deployed image running on the node can lead to unwanted changes that are not
obvious. While many unwanted changes are excluded because of the excludelistgrab* lists
during a node-to-image sync, there is a chance that some unwanted changes do get captured.
These changes can lead to unwanted or even buggy behavior. The changes from the original
deployed image should therefore be scrutinized with care before using the new image.


  - For scrutiny, the bash command:


vimdiff <(cd image1; find . | sort) <(cd image2; find . | sort)


run from /cm/images/ shows the changed files for image directories image1 and image2, with
uninteresting parts folded away. The <( _commands_ ) construction is called _[process substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html)_, for
administrators unfamiliar with this somewhat obscure technique.


**9.5 Managing Non-RPM Software In A Software Image And Running It On Nodes** **515**


**Node-To-Image Sync Using Base View**
In Base View, the software on the running node can be saved to an image. To do this for a particular
node, for example, node001, the Grab to image screen options can be navigated to via: Devices Nodes[node001] - Actions - Software image - Grab to image - _options_ (figures 9.2 and 9.3):


Figure 9.2: Synchronizing node-to-image: accessing Grab to image


Figure 9.3: Synchronizing node-to-image: screen options for Grab to image


In the Grab to image screen (figure 9.3):


1. Current image can be selected. This is the image that the running node was provisioned from.
Setting it synchronizes from the node back to the software image, using evaluation based on file
change detection between the node and the image. It is thus a synchronization to the already
existing software image that is currently in use by the node.


The items that it excludes from the synchronization are specified in the Exclude list image
grab block, navigated to via Grouping   - Node categories[default-image]   - Edit   - Settings   Exclude list grab . This exclude list is known as excludelistgrab (page 517) in cmsh .


2. Other image can be selected. The image selected must already exist, and may be other than the
image that the running node was provisioned from. Selection grabs what is to go to the image


**516** **Post-installation Software Management**


from the node. It wipes out whatever (if anything) is in the selected image, except for a list of
excluded items.


The excluded items are specified in the Exclude list grab new block, navigated to via Grouping
  - Node categories[default-image]   - Settings   - Exclude list grab new . This exclude list is
known as excludelistgrabnew (page 517) in cmsh .


The synchronization carried out when using the current image is a bit more “gentle” in carrying out
the node-to-image sync, compared to the what is done when using the other image. That is, it carries
out a “gentler sync” to avoid wiping out existing files, versus a “violent grab” to another image that can
wipe out existing files. This means that there is a difference between using Current image and using
Other image when both destination software images are the same.
The exclude lists are there to ensure, among other things, that the configuration differences between
nodes are left alone for different nodes with the same image. The exclude lists are simple by default,
but they conform in structure and patterns syntax in the same way that the exclude lists detailed in
section 5.4.7 do, and can therefore be quite powerful.
If existing images are known to work well with nodes, then overwriting them with a new image on
a production system may be reckless. A wise administrator who has prepared a node that is to write
an image would therefore follow a process similar to the following instead of simply overwriting an
existing image:


1. A new image can be cloned from the old image via the navigation path Provisioning  - Software
images   - Clone, and setting a name for the new image, for example: newimage . The node state with
the software installed on it would then be saved using the Grab to image option, and choosing
the image name newimage as the image to save it to.


2. A new category is then cloned from the old category via the navigation path Grouping  Categories   - Clone, and setting a name for the new category, for example newcategory . The old
image in newcategory is changed to the new image newimage via the navigation path Grouping   Categories   - Edit   - Settings   - Software image   - newimage .


3. A newly-cloned category has no nodes initially. Some nodes are set to the new category so that
their behavior with the new image can be tested. The chosen nodes can be made members of
the new category from within the Settings option of each node, and saving the change. The
navigation path for this is Devices    - Nodes    - Edit    - Settings    - Category    - newcategory


4. The nodes that have been placed in the new category are now made to pick up and run their new
images. This can be done with a reboot of those nodes.


5. After sufficient testing, all the remaining nodes can be moved to using the new image. The old
image is removed if no longer needed, or perhaps kept around just in case for reference.


**Node-To-Image Sync Using** cmsh
The preceding Base View method can alternatively be carried out using cmsh commands. The cmsh
equivalent to the Grab to image with the Current image option is the grabimage command, available
from device mode. The cmsh equivalent to the Grab to image with the Other image option is the
grabimage -i command, where the -i option specifies the image it will write to. As before, that image
must be created or cloned beforehand.

The following cmsh session shows how a image is cloned, how a category is set for nodes that are to
use the image, and how the running node with the new software on it is synchronized to the provisioning node that has the new image:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% softwareimage

[basecm11->softwareimage]% clone default-image default-image1


**9.6 Creating A Custom Software Image** **517**


[basecm11->softwareimage*[default-image1]]% commit

[basecm11->softwareimage[default-image1]]% category

[basecm11->category]% clone default default1

[basecm11->category*[default1*]]% commit

[basecm11->category[default1]]% set softwareimage default-image1

[basecm11->category*[default1*]]% commit

[basecm11->category[default1]]% device

[basecm11->device]% grabimage -w -i default-image1 node001

[basecm11->device]%

Mon Jul 18 16:13:00 2011 [notice] basecm11: Provisioning started on node node001

[basecm11->device]%

Mon Jul 18 16:13:04 2011 [notice] basecm11: Provisioning completed on node node001


The grabimage command without the -w option simply does a dry-run so that the user can see in the
provisioning logs what should be grabbed, without having the changes actually carried out. Running
grabimage -w instructs CMDaemon to really write the image.
When writing out the image, two exclude lists may be used:


 - excludelistgrabnew : This is used with grabimage command run with the -i option. The list can
be accessed and edited via


cmsh   - category [ _image_ ]> set excludelistgrabnew


It corresponds to the Exclude list grab new exclusion list associated with Grab to image when
using the Other image option (figure 9.3) in Base View.


 - excludelistgrab : This is used with the grabimage command, run without the -i option. The list
can be accessed and edited via


cmsh   - category [ _image_ ]> set excludelistgrab


It corresponds to the Exclude list image grab exclusion list associated with Grab to image
with the Current image option (figure 9.3) in Base View.


**9.6** **Creating A Custom Software Image**


By default, the software image used to boot non-head nodes is based on the same version and release
of the Linux distribution as used by the head node. However, sometimes an image based on a different
distribution or a different release from that on the head node may be needed.
A custom software image is created typically by building an entire filesystem image from a regular
node. The node, which is never a head node, is then called the _base host_, with the term “base” used
to indicate that it has no additional cluster manager packages installed. The distribution on the base
host, is called the _base distribution_ and is a selection of packages derived from the _parent distribution_ (Red
Hat, Scientific Linux etc.). A _base distribution package_ is a package or rpm that is directly provided by the
vendor of the parent distribution which the base distribution is based on, and is not provided by BCM.
Creating a custom software image consists of two steps. The first step (section 9.6.1) is to create a
_base (distribution) archive_ from an installed base host. The second step (section 9.6.2) is to create the image
from the base archive using a special utility, cm-create-image .
An alternative to these steps is to use the cm-image tool (section 9.7.1), which is a wrapper to
cm-create-image .


**9.6.1** **Creating A Base Distribution Archive From A Base Host**

**Structure Of The Base Distribution Archive**

The step of creating the base distribution archive is done by creating an archive structure containing the
files that are needed by the non-head node.
The filesystem that is archived in this way can differ from the special way that a Linux distribution
unpacks and installs its filesystem on to a machine. This is because the distribution installer often carries


**518** **Post-installation Software Management**


out extra changes, for example in GRUB boot configuration. The creation of the base distribution archive
is therefore a convenience to avoid working with the special logic of a distribution installer, which will
vary across distributions and versions. Instead, the filesystem and contents of a node on which this
parent distribution is installed—i.e. the end product of that logic—is what is dealt with.
The archive can be a convenient and standard tar.gz file archive (sometimes called the “base tar”),
or, taking the step a little further towards the end result, the archive can be a fully expanded archive file
tree. For convenience, a base tar is provided in the cluster installation ISO. For Ubuntu 24.04, the path
on the ISO is /data/UBUNTU2404.tar.gz :


**Example**


joe@sandbox:~$ isoinfo -R -l -i bcm-11.0-ubuntu2404.iso | grep -A6 'Directory listing of /data/$'
Directory listing of /data/
drwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 2048 May 7 2025 [ 22 02] .
drwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 2048 May 7 2025 [ 19 02] ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 0 0 370628239 May 7 2025 [ 198034 00] bcminstallerfiles.tgz
-r--r--r-- 1 0 0 147845120 May 7 2025 [ 379005 00] filesystem.squashfs
drwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 2048 May 7 2025 [ 23 02] packages
-rw-r--r-- 1 0 0 1182483439 May 7 2025 [5278054 00] UBUNTU2404.tar.gz
joe@sandbox:~$


**Repository Access Considerations When Intending To Build A Base Distribution Archive**
For convenience, the archive should be up-to-date. So, the base host used to generate the base distribution archive should ideally have updated files. If, as is usual, the base host is a regular node, then it
should ideally be up to date with the repositories that it uses. Therefore running yum update or zypper
up on the base host image, and then provisioning the image to the base host, is recommended in order
to allow the creation of an up-to-date base distribution archive.
However sometimes updates are not possible or desirable for the base host. This means that the
base host archive that is put together from the base host filesystem is an un-updated archive. The
custom image that is to be created from the archive must then be also be created without accessing the
repositories, in order to avoid dependency problems with the package versions. Exclusion of access to
the repositories is possible by specifying options to the cm-create-image command, and is described in
section 9.6.2.


**Examples Of How To Build A Base Distribution Archive**
In the following example, a base distribution tar.gz archive /tmp/BASEDIST.tar.gz is created from
the base host basehost64 . The archive that is created should normally have access control lists and
extended attributes preserved too:


**Example**


ssh root@basehost64 \

"tar -cz \

--exclude /etc/HOSTNAME --exclude /etc/localtime \

--exclude /proc --exclude /lost+found --exclude /sys \
--exclude /root/.ssh --exclude /var/lib/dhcpcd/* \
--exclude /media/floppy --exclude /etc/motd \
--exclude /root/.bash_history --exclude /root/CHANGES \
--exclude /etc/udev/rules.d/*persistent*.rules \
--exclude /var/spool/mail/* --exclude /rhn \
--exclude /etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid --exclude /tmp/* \
--exclude /var/spool/up2date/* --exclude /var/log/* \
--exclude /etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid.save \
--exclude /root/mbox --exclude /var/cache/yum/* \
--exclude /etc/cron.daily/rhn-updates /" > /tmp/BASEDIST.tar.gz


**9.6 Creating A Custom Software Image** **519**


Or alternatively, a fully expanded archive file tree can be created from basehost64 by rsync ing to an
existing directory (here it is /cm/images/new-image ):


**Example**


rsync -av --hard-links --numeric-ids \
--exclude=/etc/HOSTNAME --exclude=/etc/localtime --exclude=/proc \
--exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/sys --exclude=/root/.ssh \
--exclude=/var/lib/dhcpcd/* --exclude=/media/floppy \
--exclude=/etc/motd --exclude=/root/.bash_history \
--exclude=/root/CHANGES --exclude=/var/spool/mail/* \
--exclude=/etc/udev/rules.d/*persistent*.rules \
--exclude=/rhn --exclude=/etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid \
--exclude=/etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid.save --exclude=/tmp/* \
--exclude=/var/spool/up2date/* --exclude=/var/log/* \
--exclude=/root/mbox --exclude=/var/cache/yum/* \
--exclude=/etc/cron.daily/rhn-updates \
root@basehost64:/ /cm/images/new-image/


**SELinux and file attributes:** To use SELinux on compute nodes, extended attributes must not be used.
The defaults can be modified, if needed, by adjusting attributes for partitions via cmsh, in fspart
mode:


**Example**


[basecm11->fspart]% foreach * (set rsyncxattr no)

[basecm11->fspart*]% list -f path:0,rsyncxattr
path (key) rsyncxattr

----------------------------- -------------------
/cm/images/default-image no
/cm/images/default-image/boot no

/cm/node-installer no

/cm/shared no

/tftpboot no
/var/spool/cmd/monitoring no


Having built the archive by following the examples suggested, the first step in creating the software
image is now complete.


**9.6.2** **Creating The Software Image With** cm-create-image
The second step, that of creating the image from the base archive, now needs to be done. This uses the
cm-create-image utility, which is part of the cluster-tools package.
The cm-create-image utility uses the base archive as the base for creating the image. By default, it
expects that the base distribution repositories be accessible just in case files need to be fetched from a
repository package.
Thus, when the cm-create-image utility is run with no options, the image created mostly picks up
the software only from the base archive. However, the image picks up software from the repository
packages:


  - if it is required as part of a dependency, or


  - if it is specified as part of the package selection file (page 521).


If a repository package file is used, then it should be noted that the repository package files may be
more recent compared with the files in the base archive. This can result in an image with files that are
perhaps unexpectedly more recent in version than what might be expected from the base archive, which


**520** **Post-installation Software Management**


may cause compatibility issues. To prevent this situation, the --exclude option (section 9.2) can be used
to exclude updates for the packages that are not to be updated.
Repository access can be directly to the online repositories provided by the distribution, or it can be
to a local copy. For RHEL, online repository access can be activated by registering with the Red Hat
Network (section 5.1 of the _Installation Manual_ ). Similarly, for SUSE, online repository access can be
activated by registering with Novell (section 5.2 of the _Installation Manual_ ). An offline repository can be
constructed as described in section 9.6.3 of this manual.


**Usage Of The** cm-create-image **Command**
The usage information for cm-create-image is:


[root@head ~]# cm-create-image -h
usage: cm-create-image [-a FROMARCHIVE | -d FROMDIR | -h FROMHOST | --frombfb FROMBFB | -k]

[--cmdvd CMDVD] [--add-only] [--arch IMAGE_ARCH] [--os IMAGE_OS]

[-c CMREPO] [-b BASEDISTREPO] [-e] [-f] [-g ENABLEEXTRAREPO] [--help]

[-i IMAGEDIR] [-j EXCLUDEDIST] [--holdpackages HOLDPACKAGES]

[--no-holdpackages] [-l RESOLVCONF] [-m] [-n IMAGENAME] [-o EXCLUDE_FROM]

[-q EXCLUDEHWVENDOR] [-r] [-s] [-t {node-installer,cmshared}] [-u] [-v]

[-w HWVENDOR] [-x EXCLUDECM] [-y] [-z CUSTOM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT]

[--no-progress] [-L LOGFILE] [--sles-allow-vendor-change]

[--skip-connectivity-check] [--tar-options ...] [--no-cm-repo-extra]

[--cmshared-reinstall]


**Examples In Usage Of** cm-create-image
Explanations of the usage text follow:


1. In the following, a base distribution archive file, /tmp/ROCKY9.tar.gz, is written out to a software
image named rocky9-image :


cm-create-image --fromarchive /tmp/ROCKY9.tar.gz --imagename rocky9-image


The image with the name rocky9-image is created in the CMDaemon database, making it available for use by cmsh and Base View. If an image with the above name already exists, then
/cm/create-image will exit and advise the administrator to provide an alternate name.


By default, the image name specified sets the directory into which the software image is installed.
Thus here the directory is /cm/images/rocky9-image/ .


2. Instead of the image getting written into the default directory as in the previous item, an alternative directory can be specified with the --imagedir option. Thus, in the following, the base
distribution archive file, /tmp/ROCKY9.tar.gz is written out to the /cm/images/test-image directory. The software image is given the name rocky9-image :


cm-create-image --fromarchive /tmp/ROCKY9.tar.gz --imagename rocky9-image --imagedir \
/cm/images/test-image


3. If the contents of the base distribution file tree have been transferred to a directory, then no extraction is needed. The --fromdir option can then be used with that directory. Thus, in the
following, the archive has already been transferred to the directory /cm/images/SLES15-image,
and it is that directory which is then used to place the image under a directory named
/cm/images/sles15-image/ . Also, the software image is given the name sles15-image :


cm-create-image --fromdir /cm/images/SLES15-image --imagename sles15-image


**9.6 Creating A Custom Software Image** **521**


   - **skipping:** Sometimes the installation of additional base distribution packages may need to be
skipped. For example, if the target image already has the required base distribution packages,
as in DGX OS., then the --skipdist option must be used to skip package installation:


cm-create-image --fromdir /cm/images/dgx-image --imagename dgx-image --skipdist


   - **updating:** If the software image already exists in CMDaemon, and if the target directory
contents need to be updated, then the --updateimage option can be used:


cm-create-image --fromdir /cm/images/dgx-image --imagename dgx-image --updateimage


   - **skipping and updating** : Applying both options means skipping the installation of additional
base distribution packages, and then updating the software image, which can be an efficient
way to set up an up-to-date DGX image:


cm-create-image --fromdir /cm/images/login-image-a100-test --imagename _\_

login-image-a100-test --updateimage --skipdist


4. A software image can be created from a running node using the --fromhost option. This option
makes cm-create-image behave in a similar manner to grabimage (section 9.5.2) in cmsh . It requires passwordless access to the node in order to work. Generic nodes, that is nodes that are not
managed by BCM, can also be used. An image named node001-image can then be created from a
running node named node001 as follows:


cm-create-image --fromhost node001 --imagename node001-image


By default the image goes under the /cm/images/node001-image/ directory.


5. The --basedistrepo flag is used together with a .repo file. The file defines the base distribution
repository for the image. The file is copied over into the repository directory of the image, ( /etc/
yum.repos.d/ for Red Hat and similar, or /etc/zypp/repos.d/ for SLES).


6. The --cmrepo flag is used together with a .repo file. The file defines the cluster manager repository
for the image. The file is copied over into the repository directory of the image, ( /etc/yum.repos.
d/ for Red Hat and similar, or /etc/zypp/repos.d/ for SLES).


7. A default node software image can be created with:


cm-create-image --imagename default-image --fromarchive < _path to base archive_   - ...


8. A default node-installer image can be created with:


cm-create-image --imagename node-installer --image-type node-installer --fromarchive _\_
< _path to base archive_   - ...


9. A default DGX platform image can be created from a vanilla Ubuntu 24.04 basetar with:


cm-create-image --fromarchive=/mnt/install/UBUNTU2404.tar.gz --imagedir=/cm/images/dgxos-image _\_

--imagename=ubuntu2404 --dgx


**Package Selection Files In** cm-create-image
In the preceding explanations text, the selection of packages on the head node is done using a _package_
_selection file_ .
Package selection files are available in /cm/local/apps/cluster-tools/config/ . For example, if
the base distribution of the software image being created is Rocky Linux 8, then the configuration file
used is:


**522** **Post-installation Software Management**


/cm/local/apps/cluster-tools/config/ROCKY8-config-dist.xml


The package selection file is made up of a list of XML elements, specifying the image type of the
package, its name, and architecture. For example:


...

<package image="master" name="adwaita-cursor-theme" arch="noarch" platforms="x86_64 aarch64" />
<package image="master" name="adwaita-gtk2-theme" arch="platform" platforms="x86_64" />
<package image="master" name="adwaita-icon-theme" arch="noarch" platforms="x86_64 aarch64" />
<package image="master" name="alsa-lib" arch="platform" platforms="x86_64 aarch64" />

...


The minimal set of packages in the list defines the minimal distribution that works with BCM, and
is the base-distribution set of packages, which may not work with some features of the distribution or
BCM. To this minimal set the following packages may be added to create the custom image:


  - Packages from the standard repository of the parent distribution. These can be added to enhance
the custom image or to resolve a dependency of BCM. For example, in the (parent) Red Hat distribution, packages can be added from the (standard) main Red Hat channel to the base-distribution.


  - Packages from outside the standard repository, but still from inside the parent distribution. These
can be added to enhance the custom image or to resolve a dependency of BCM. For example,
outside the main Red Hat channel, but still within the parent distribution of RHEL7, there is an
extra, supplementary, and an optional packages channel. Packages from these channels can be
added to the base-distribution to enhance the capabilities of the image or resolve dependencies
of BCM. Section 9.1 of the _Installation Manual_ considers an example of such a dependency for the
CUDA package.


Unless the required distribution packages and dependencies are installed and configured, particular
features of BCM, such as CUDA, cannot work correctly or cannot work at all.
The package selection file also contains entries for the packages that can be installed on the head
( image="master" ) node. Therefore non-head node packages must have the image="slave" attribute.


**Kernel Module Selection By** cm-create-image
For an image created by cm-create-image, with a distribution < _dist_ >, the default list of kernel modules to be loaded during boot are read from the file /cm/local/apps/cluster-tools/
config/ < _dist_ - -slavekernelmodules .
< _dist_  - can take the value RHEL8U7, RHEL8U8, RHEL8U9, RHEL9U1, RHEL9U2, RHEL9U3, ROCKY8U7,

ROCKY8U8, ROCKY8U9, ROCKY9U1, ROCKY9U2, ROCKY9U3, SLES15, SLES15SP4, SLES15SP5, SLES15SP6,

UBUNTU1804, UBUNTU2004, UBUNTU2204, UBUNTU2404 .
If custom kernel modules are to be added to the image, they can be added to this file.


**Output And Logging During A** cm-create-image **Run**
The cm-create-image run goes through several stages: validation, sanity checks, finalizing the base distribution, copying the BCM repository files, installing distribution packages, finalizing image services,
and installing the BCM packages. An indication is given if any of these stages fail.
Further detail is available in the logs of the cm-create-image run, which are kept in logs of the form
/var/log/cm-create-image- _<image name>_ .log, where _<image name>_ is the name of the built image.


**Default Image Location**
The default-image is at /cm/images/default-image, so the image directory can simply be kept as
/cm/images/ .
During a cm-create-image run, the --imagedir option allows an image directory for the image to
be specified. This must exist before the option is used.
More generally, the full path for each image can be set:


**9.6 Creating A Custom Software Image** **523**


  - Using Base View via the navigation path Provisioning  - Software Images  - Settings  - Path


  - In cmsh within softwareimage mode, for example:


[basecm11->softwareimage]% set new-image path /cm/higgs/new-images


  - At the system level, the images or image directory can be symlinked to other locations for organizational convenience


**9.6.3** **Configuring Local Repositories For Linux Distributions, And For The BCM Package**
**Repository, For A Software Image**
Using local instead of remote repositories can be useful in the following cases:


  - for clusters that have restricted or no internet access.


  - for the RHEL and SUSE Linux distributions, which are based on a subscription and support model,
and therefore do not have free access to their repositories.


  - for creating a custom image with the cm-create-image command introduced in section 9.6.2, using local base distribution repositories.


The administrator can choose to access an online repository provided by the distribution itself via a
subscription as described in Chapter 5 of the _Installation Manual_ . Another way to set up a repository is
to set it up as a local repository, which may be offline, or perhaps set up as a locally-controlled proxy
with occasional, restricted, updates from the distribution repository.
In the three procedures that follow, the first two procedures explain how to create and configure a local offline SLES zypper or RHEL YUM repository for the subscription-based base distribution packages.
These first two procedures assume that the corresponding ISO/DVD has been purchased/downloaded
from the appropriate vendors. The third procedure then explains how to create a local offline YUM
repository from the BCM ISO for CentOS so that a cluster that is completely offline still has a complete
and consistent repository access.
Thus, a summary list of what these procedures are about is:


  - Setting up a local repository for SLES (page 523)


  - Setting up a local repository for RHEL (page 524)


  - Setting up a local repository for CentOS and BCM from the BCM ISO for CentOS (page 524)


**Configuring Local Repositories For SLES For A Software Image**
For SLES11 SP0, SLES11 SP1, and SLES11 SP2, the required packages are spread
across two DVDs, and hence two repositories must be created. Assuming the image directory is /cm/images/sles11sp1-image, while the names of the DVDs are
SLES-11-SP1-SDK-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso and SLES-11-SP1-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso, then
the contents of the DVDs can be copied as follows:


mkdir /mnt1 /mnt2

mkdir /cm/images/sles11sp1-image/root/repo1
mkdir /cm/images/sles11sp1-image/root/repo2
mount -o loop,ro SLES-11-SP1-SDK-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso /mnt1
cp -ar /mnt1/* /cm/images/sles11sp1-image/root/repo1/
mount -o loop,ro SLES-11-SP1-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso /mnt2
cp -ar /mnt2/* /cm/images/sles11sp1-image/root/repo2/


The two repositories can be added for use by zypper in the image, as follows:


chroot /cm/images/sles11sp1-image
zypper addrepo /root/repo1 "SLES11SP1-SDK"
zypper addrepo /root/repo2 "SLES11SP1"

exit (chroot)


**524** **Post-installation Software Management**


**Configuring Local Repositories For RHEL For A Software Image**
For RHEL distributions, the procedure is almost the same. The required packages are contained in one
DVD.


mkdir /mnt1

mkdir /cm/images/rhel-image/root/repo1
mount -o loop,ro RHEL-DVD1.iso /mnt1
cp -ar /mnt1/* /cm/images/rhel-image/root/repo1/


The repository is added to YUM in the image, by creating the repository file /cm/images/
rhel-image/etc/yum.repos.d/rhel-base.repo with the following contents:


[base]

name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux $releasever - $basearch - Base
baseurl=file:///root/repo1/Server

gpgcheck=0

enabled=1


**Configuring Local Repositories For CentOS And BCM For A Software Image**
**Mounting the ISOs** The variable $imagedir is assigned as a shortcut for the software image that is to
be configured to use a local repository:


imagedir=/cm/images/default-image


If the ISO is called basecom-centos.iso, then its filesystem can be mounted by the root user on a
new mount, /mnt1, as follows:


mkdir /mnt1

mount -o loop basecom-centos.iso /mnt1


The head node can then access the ISO filesystem.
The same mounted filesystem can also be mounted with the bind option into the software image.
This can be done (from outside the chroot jail) inside the software image by the root user, in the same
relative position as for the head node, as follows:


mkdir $imagedir/mnt1
mount -o bind /mnt1 $imagedir/mnt1


This allows an operation run under the $imagedir in a chroot environment to access the ISO filesys
tem too.


**Creating YUM repository configuration files:** YUM repository configuration files can be created:


 - **for the head node:** A repository configuration file


/etc/yum.repos.d/cmHEAD-dvd.repo


can be created, for example, for a release tagged with a <subminor> number tag, with the content:


[BCM-repo]

name=NVIDIA Base Command Manager DVD Repo
baseurl=file:///mnt1/data/packages/HEAD-<subminor>

enabled=1

gpgcheck=1

exclude = slurm* pbspro* cm-hwloc


 - **for the regular node image:** A repository configuration file


$imagedir/etc/yum.repos.d/cmHEAD-dvd.repo


can be created. This file is in the image directory, but it has the same content as the previous head
node yum repository configuration file.


**9.7 Creating Images For Other Distributions And Architectures (Multidistro And Multiarch)** **525**


**Verifying that the repository files are set up right:** To verify the repositories are usable on the head
node, the YUM cache can be cleaned, and the available repositories listed:


[root@basecm11 ~]# yum clean all

[root@basecm11 ~]# yum repolist -v

BCM-repo NVIDIA Base Command Manager DVD Repo

...


To carry out the same verification on the image, these commands can be run with
yum --installroot=$imagedir substituted in place of just yum .
The ISO repository should show up, along with any others that are accessible. Connection attempts
that fail to reach a network-based or local repositories display errors. If those repositories are not needed,
they can be disabled from within their configuration files.


**9.6.4** **Creating A Custom Image From The Local Repository**
After having created the local repositories for SLES, RHEL or CentOS/Rocky (section 9.6.3), a custom
software image based on one of these can be created. For example, for CentOS, in a directory given the
arbitrary name offlineimage :


cm-create-image -d $imagedir -n offlineimage -e -s


The -e option prevents copying the default cluster manager repository files on top of the image being
created, since they may have been changed by the administrator from their default status. The -s option
prevents installing additional base distribution packages that might not be required.


**9.7** **Creating Images For Other Distributions And Architectures (Multidistro**
**And Multiarch)**


NVIDIA Base Command Manager version 9.0 onward makes it easier to mix distributions in the cluster.
This ability is called _multidistro_ . However, it is often also loosely called _multiOS_ .
NVIDIA Base Command Manager version 9.0 also introduced the ability to run on certain mixed
architecture combinations. The ability to run on multiple architectures is called _multiarch_ . For BCM,
multiarch means that the node hardware can be based on either the x86-64 CPU architecture, or the
ARMv8 CPU architecture, or on a mixture of both.
The Linux distributions and the hardware architectures supported by NVIDIA Base Command Manager 11.0 are shown in the following table 9.1:

|Col1|Head<br>RHEL8 RHEL9 Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04 SLES15<br>(x86-64, aarch64) (x86-64, aarch64) (x86-64, aarch64) (x86-64)|
|---|---|
|**Image**<br>RHEL8<br>RHEL9<br>Ubuntu 22.04<br>Ubuntu 24.04<br>SLES15|x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64, aarch64<br>x86-64<br>x86-64<br>x86-64<br>x86-64<br>x86-64|



_**Table 9.1:**_ _Images generated by_ cm-image _that work with head nodes, per architecture and distribution_


For example, a head node running Ubuntu 22.04, on x86-64 or ARMv8 hardware, can support an
Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04, RHEL8, RHEL9 distribution running on x86-64 and on ARMv8 hardware


**526** **Post-installation Software Management**


for the compute nodes. In addition, that same head node supports running SLES15 on the compute
nodes, but only for x86-64 hardware.


**The** nodearchosinfo **Command**

The nodearchosinfo command helps the cluster administrator see what architectures and distributions
are configured and reported on the nodes:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11->device]% device nodearchosinfo

Hostname Reported arch Reported OS Reported timestamp Configured arch Configured OS

---------- ---------------- ---------------- --------------------- ---------------- ---------------
basecm11 x86_64 ubuntu2204 Wed Nov 13 07:12:37 x86_64 ubuntu2204

node001 x86_64 ubuntu2204 Wed Nov 13 07:18:07 x86_64 ubuntu2204

node002 x86_64 ubuntu2204 Wed Nov 13 07:17:01 x86_64 ubuntu2204

node003 x86_64 ubuntu2204 Wed Nov 13 07:17:01 x86_64 ubuntu2204

...


For the reported fields, attention should be paid to the timestamps. A reported state is only updated
when CMDaemon on the node reports the OS and architecture. Until that event, the reported state
reports the last known value. This means that if the node fails to run after a reboot attempt is made,
then the reported states are not updated, and the timestamps do not change.


To configure multiarch and multidistro, the cm-image tool is used.


**9.7.1** **The** cm-image **Tool**
The cm-image tool is essentially a wrapper for the cm-create-image (section 9.6) tool. The cm-image
tool however has some extra features, including allowing the cluster administrator


  - to create a separate node-installer image as well as a separate software image


  - to create a directory under /cm/shared for each image


  - to select the architecture


  - to manage packages in an image more easily


When used to enable a distribution for the first time, multiple changes are made to critical files and
paths that may put the regular nodes into an unstable state. This means that all regular nodes should be
rebooted after its first use.
The command options of cm-image are illustrated by the following modes and options tree:

**Adding Several Update Versions Alongside Each Other**
In the following session, a Rocky9u3 x86 archived base tar is being added with cm-image . A Rocky9u2
software image is then being added with cm-create-image, using the same node-installer and /cm/shared/
images directory:


[root@basecm11 ~]# module load cm-image

[root@basecm11 ~]# cm-image --verbose create all -a x86_64 -d rocky9u3 --source _\_
/root/basetar/data/ROCKY9u3.tar.gz

[root@basecm11 ~]# cm-create-image -a /run/ROCKY9u2.tar.gz -f -n _\_
default-image-rocky9u2-x86_64 -i /cm/images/default-image-rocky9u2-x86_64 -g public

[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% device use node001

[basecm11->device[node001]]% set category default-rocky9u3-x86_64

[basecm11->device[node001]]% set softwareimage default-rocky9u2-x86_64


**Configuring CMDaemon With The Software Image, Node-installer, Or Shared Filesystem**
The cm-image tool can be used to add a CMDaemon configuration for a software image, node-installer,
or shared filesystem to a CMDaemon database.
If a cm-image -generated image directory, for example default-image-ubuntu2404-x86_64, has been
copied over from another cluster:


[root@basecm11 images]# pwd; ls -l
/cm/images

total 0

dr-xr-xr-x 21 root root 295 Mar 20 23:47 default-image

drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 247 Mar 25 12:56 default-image-ubuntu2404-x86_64


then the local CMDaemon can be configured for it with the --add-only option:


[root@basecm11 ~]# module load cm-image

[root@basecm11 ~]# cm-image create swimage -a x86_64 -d ubuntu2404 --add-only


**9.7.3** **Multiarch Example: Creating An Image From A Centos 8 Head Node For ARMv8**
**Architecture Regular Nodes**
This section explains how to configure a software image for a regular node that runs on ARMv8 hardware, assuming BCM is installed on a head node (Chapter 3 of the _Installation Manual_ ).
Assuming an ARMv8 ISO bright91-rhel8u2.aarch64.iso has been picked up, it can be mounted
for web access with:


[root@basecm11 ~]# mkdir /var/www/html/aarch64-iso

[root@basecm11 ~]# mount -o loop /root/bright91-rhel8u2.aarch64.iso /var/www/html/aarch64-iso


A repository file can be created with the following content:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cat /root/rhel8-aarch64-cm-iso.repo

[dist-packages-rhel8-aarch64]

name=Dist packages rhel8 aarch64
baseurl=http://10.141.255.254/aarch64-iso/data/packages/dist

enabled=1

gpgcheck=0


**9.7 Creating Images For Other Distributions And Architectures (Multidistro And Multiarch)** **531**


[cm-packages-rhel8-aarch64]

name=CM packages rhel8 aarch64
baseurl=http://10.141.255.254/aarch64-iso/data/packages/9.1

enabled=1

gpgcheck=0


[cm-packages-rhel8-aarch64-hpc]

name=CM packages rhel8 aarch64 HPC
baseurl=http://10.141.255.254/aarch64-iso/data/packages/packagegroups/hpc

enabled=1

gpgcheck=0


This assumes that the head node has the IP address 10.141.255.254. It should be changed if needed.
It also assumes the HEAD packages are in the HEAD packages directory of the ISO. If it is not, then
the corresponding baseurl string should be changed if needed. Thus, if, for example, after inspecting
the loop-mounted paths under /var/www/html/, the relative path data/packages/9.1 has changed to
data/packages/9.1-6, then the baseurl should be changed to end in 9.1-6 instead of 9.1 too.
The images can then be created with:


[root@basecm11 ~]# module load cm-image

[root@basecm11 ~]# cm-image --verbose create all -a aarch64 -d rhel8 --source _\_
/var/www/html/aarch64-iso/data/RHEL8u2.tar.gz -b /root/rhel8-aarch64-cm-iso.repo -c _\_
/root/rhel8-aarch64-cm-iso.repo


This takes a while to complete. At the end of the process the following ARMv8 images and entities
are created by default:


  - The node-installer image: /cm/node-installer-rhel8-aarch64


  - The /cm/shared-... directory: /cm/shared-rhel8-aarch64


  - The node image: /cm/images/default-image-rhel8-aarch64


  - The node category: default-rhel8-aarch64


The preceding can be verified via cmsh :


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% category list
Name (key) Software image Nodes

------------------------ -------------------------------------- -------
default-centos8-x86_64 default-image 1

default-rhel8-aarch64 default-image-rhel8-aarch64 1

[basecm11]% softwareimage list
Name (key) Path ...

--------------------------- -------------------------------------- ...

default-image /cm/images/default-image ...
default-image-rhel8-aarch64 /cm/images/default-image-rhel8-aarch64 ...

[basecm11]% partition archos base; list

Arch OS Primary image Shared Installer

------- ----- --------------------------- ------------------------- --------------------------------
x86_64 rhel8 default-image /cm/shared-centos8-x86_64 /cm/node-installer-centos8-x86_64
aarch64 rhel8 default-image-rhel8-aarch64 /cm/shared-rhel8-aarch64 /cm/node-installer-rhel8-aarch64


The node settings should be updated. The new category can be assigned to any ARMv8 nodes:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% device use arm-node001

[basecm11->device[node001]]% set category default-rhel8-aarch64

[basecm11->device*[node001*]]% commit


**532** **Post-installation Software Management**


**Carrying out changes to** primaryimage **requires an associated category:** The value defined for the
property primaryimage decides the software image used to boot new nodes. The image also tracks
what packages are used under its associated shared directory, via the RPM or APT database. The image
for primaryimage and the associated shared directory can be set with cmsh from within the archos
submode, under the top-level partition mode.


**Example**


[basecm11->partition[base]->archos]% list

Arch OS Primary image Shared Installer

------- ------------ --------------------------------- ------------------------------ --------
aarch64 ubuntu1804 default-image-ubuntu1804-aarch64 /cm/shared-ubuntu1804-aarch64 /cm/n....
x86_64 rhel8 default-image /cm/shared-centos8-x86_64 /cm/n....

[basecm11->partition[base]->archos]% use aarch64/ubuntu1804

[basecm11->partition[base]->archos[aarch64/ubuntu1804]]% set primaryimage

default-image default-image-ubuntu1804-aarch64 new-image-ubuntu1804-aarch64

[basecm11->...->archos[aarch64/ubuntu1804]]% set primaryimage new-image-ubuntu1804-aarch64

[basecm11->partition*[base*]->archos*[aarch64/ubuntu1804*]]% commit


If cm-image is used to generate a new architecture and operating system, then the primary image is
automatically set. Otherwise, by default, the value of primaryimage is not set.
If the value of primaryimage is set, then it is strongly recommended that a category that has that
image must exist.
If such a category does not exist, then CMDaemon uses the RPM or APT database of the new image
to decide what the packages are on the shared directory.
If the value of primaryimage is set and multiple categories use the image, then the first category that
is found is used.


**Setting the** bootloaderprotocol **for ARMv8 hardware:** The bootloaderprotocol should be set to
tftp to work with ARMv8 hardware:


**Example**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% category use default-rhel8-aarch64

[basecm11->category[default-rhel8-aarch64]]% set bootloaderprotocol tftp

[basecm11->category*[default-rhel8-aarch64*]]% commit


**Setting the** kernelconsoleoutput **for ARMv8 hardware:** The kernelconsoleoutput should be changed
to ttyAMA0 to work with the image running on the ARMv8 hardware:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% softwareimage use default-rhel8-aarch64

[basecm11->softwareimage[default-rhel8-aarch64]]% set kerneloutputconsole ttyAMA0

[basecm11->softwareimage*[default-rhel8-aarch64*]]% commit


The settings configured so far are for generic ARMv8 hardware.


**Fujitsu ARMv8 Hardware Configuration**
Nodes using Fujitsu ARMv8 hardware can have their configuration options modified further.
The BMC settings of the nodes should be updated with extra arguments:


**Example**


**9.7 Creating Images For Other Distributions And Architectures (Multidistro And Multiarch)** **533**


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% device use arm-node001

[basecm11->device[node001]]% bmcsettings; set extraarguments "-L USER -t 0x30"

[basecm11->device*[node001*]]% commit


The configuration for fetching environmental metrics should also be updated. The ipmitool monitoring resource available for Fujitsu ARMv8 hardware is run via the a64fx resource.
The existence of the a64fx monitoring resource can be checked for on the ARMv8 node:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% device monitoringresources arm-node001 | grep a64fx

a64fx


The monitoring settings for IPMI via the a64fx object can be enabled as follows:


[root@basecm11 ~]# cmsh

[basecm11]% monitoring setup; use ipmi

[basecm11->monitoring->setup[ipmi]]% set script /cm/local/apps/cmd/scripts/metrics/sample_ipmitool.py

[basecm11->monitoring->setup*[ipmi*]]% executionmultiplexers

[basecm11->monitoring->setup*[ipmi*]->executionmultiplexers]% remove ipmi

[basecm11->monitoring->setup*[ipmi*]->executionmultiplexers*]% add resource a64fx

[basecm11->monitoring->setup*[ipmi*]->executionmultiplexers*[a64fx*]]% set resources a64fx

[basecm11->monitoring->setup*[ipmi*]->executionmultiplexers*[a64fx*]]% commit
